<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Why Can&#39;t You Unscramble an Egg? and other not such dumb questions about matter</h2><p>Answers nine questions about matter, such as why does an ice cube float?, how much does air weigh?, how does wood burn? and other concepts about the nature of matter.</p><p>Grade 3-6-- Simple principles about the nature of matter are clearly and sometimes humorously explained in this short but effective book. Each chapter begins with a question, some of which initially seem rather silly (e.g., How much does air weigh? Why isn't the Earth egg - shaped or a cube?). Cobb uses these questions as starting points for further discussion of various scientific principles. Included are a fewactivities that children can perform on their own. The book is illustrated with black-and-white cartoon line drawings, which add to the author's lighthearted tone. Despite the fact that an adequate index is included, the book has limited usefulness as a source for reports. It is, however, an excellent book for students who are curious about science and are interested in exploringit on their own. --Todd Morning, Schaumburg Township Pub .

Ajo Kawir, a lower-class Javanese teenage boy excited about sex, likes to spy on fellow villagers in flagrante, but one night he ends up witnessing the savage rape of a beautiful crazy woman by two policemen. Deeply traumatized, he becomes impotent. His efforts to get his virility back all fail, and Ajo Kawir turns to fighting as a way to vent his frustrations. He gets such a fearsome reputation as a brawler that he is hired to kill a thug named The Tiger, but instead Ajo Kawir falls in love with Iteung, a gorgeous female bodyguard who works for the local mafia. Alas, the course of true love never did run smooth... Fast-forward a decade. Now a truck driver, Ajo Kawir has reached a new equanimity, thinking that his penis may be trying to teach him a lesson and even consulting it in many situations as if it were his guru&#x2015;love may yet triumph.</p><p><em>Vengeance Is Mine, All Others Pay Cash</em> shows Eka Kurniawan in a gritty, comic, pungent mode that fans of Quentin Tarantino will appreciate. But even with its liberal peppering of fights, high-speed car chases, and ladies heaving with desire, the novel continues to explore Kurniawan&#x2019;s familiar themes of female agency in a violent male world dominated by petty criminals and a corrupt police state.</p></p><p><p>The internationally acclaimed author of <em>Beauty Is a Wound</em> and <em>Man Tiger</em>, <strong>Eka Kurniawan</strong> was born in West Java in 1975, the day that the little ex-Portuguese colony East Timor declared its sovereign independence.</p><p><strong>Annie Tucker</strong>&nbsp;won a PEN/Heim Translation Fund Award for her Eka Kurniawan translation.</p>&#x201c;Kurniawan tells the ribald, noir-inflected, and oddly epic story of a man&#x2019;s quest to regain his sexual virility...This is an almost unbelievably fun and weird novel.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly (starred review)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The physicality of his prose and his story is invigorating.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Paris Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Political and profound, even though it uses language drawn from pulp fiction and popular movies.

The power of the land, the strength of the whanau, are life-preserving forces. This rich and dramatic novel, threaded with humor, by one of New Zealand's finest writers presents a powerful picture of Maori in modern times.</p></p><p><b>Patricia Grace</b> is the first Maori woman to publish a collection of short stories (1975). Since then she has published three other short story collections, three award-winning novels, and several children's books. Her novel <i>Dogside Story</i> (UH Press edition, 2002) won the 2001 Kiriyama Prize for fiction. She is widely anthologized and translated into more than eight languages, and is considered not only one of the finest writers in New Zealand and the Pacific, but one of the most important writers of the post-colonial novel in English in the world today.&#34;A sheer delight in its exuberance and in its nonjudgmental understanding of both the destructive and the productive aspects of human interaction.&#34;</p><h2>Gist of Art: Principles and Practice Expounded in the Classroom and Studio</h2><p>John Sloan, a highly estemmed member of &#34;The Eight&#34; or &#34;Ashcan School&#34; of American painting, was also an extraordinary teacher at the Art Students League for many years, where a great many of our best contemporary artists were influenced by his remarkable talks on art theory and practice. Chapters deal with many types of painting, technique, and visual art, whole ranges of art concepts and concerns are stated in Sloan&#39;s memorably clear, almost offhanded manner, and this edition also includes a detailed chronology of Sloan&#39;s career, illustrations of 23 of his painting and 8 photographs of the artist and his studio. A valuable summary of basic art theory and the practice of the art.</p><p></p><h2>Corambis</h2><p><b>The spellbinding conclusion to the brilliant fantasy series by the author of <i>The Mirador</i> and <i>M�lusine</i>.</b><br><br> Exiled from M�lusine for the crime of heresy, the once powerful Cabaline wizard Felix Harrowgate and his half-brother Mildmay, former cat-burglar and assassin, journey to Corambis to face judgment from a ruling body of wizards. Corambis, however, is a land plagued by civil strife. Kay Brightmore, the Margrave of Rothmarlin, is part of an insurrection to restore the monarchy in the southern half of the country. In desperation, Kay and his rebels seek out the engine of Summerdown, an ancient magical device rumored to have terrible powers. Once the engine is awakened, only a powerful wizard can stop its awesome potential for destruction. Felix and Mildmay arrive just in time for their greatest challenge-and ultimate destiny...</p><p>Sarah Monette recieved the 2003 Spectrum Award for her short story, "Three Letters from the Queen of Elfland." This is her first novel.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>The rambling conclusion to Monette's M�lusine fantasy quartet (after 2008's <i>The Mirador</i>) reveals the destiny of three exiles. Prince Gerrard Hume dies in an attempt to start the sinister Cymellunar engine, which he hoped would help win Caloxa's independence from Corambis. Blinded by the engine, Kay Brightmore, the margrave of Rothmarlin and the prince's illicit lover, is imprisoned by Corambis's duke of Glimmering. Meanwhile, far away in Bernatha, gay wizard Felix Harrowgate returns to prostitution to raise money when his half-brother becomes ill, but is gang-raped by Corambins in a ritual that restarts the Clock of Eclipses, another terrible Cymellunar device. Monette throws in numerous unsubtle lessons on love, lust and power, but for full effect, the intricate plot requires familiarity with prior installments. <i>(Apr.) </i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He briefly attended Stanford University before leaving to experience the "real world," which included working as a logger, construction worker, freelance journalist, and a researcher in childhood development. For the last twenty years he has made his home in St. Paul, Minnesota, with his wife and two teenage children. His first three award-winning novels, <i>Iron Lake, Boundary Waters,</i> and <i>Purgatory Ridge,</i> are available from Atria Books, as is the recently published thriller <i>The Devil's Bed.</i><p><b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p><br> January, as usual, was meat locker cold, and the girl had already been missing for nearly two days. Corcoran O'Connor couldn't ignore the first circumstance. The second he tried not to think about. </p><p> He stood in snow up to his ass, more than two feet of drifted powder blinding white in the afternoon sun. He lifted his tinted goggles and glanced at the sky, a blue ceiling held up by green walls of pine. He stood on a ridge that overlooked a small oval of ice called Needle Lake, five miles from the nearest maintained road. Aside from the track his snowmobile had pressed into the powder, there was no sign of human life. A rugged vista lay before him -- an uplifted ridge, a jagged shoreline, a bare granite pinnacle that jutted from the ice and gave the lake its name -- but the recent snowfall had softened the look of the land. In his time, Cork had seen nearly fifty winters come and go. Sometimes the snow fell softly, sometimes it came in a rage. Always it changed the face of whatever it touched. Cork couldn't help thinking that in this respect, snow was a little like death. Except that death, when it changed a thing, changed it forever. </p><p> He took off his mittens, deerskin lined with fleece. He turned back to the Polaris snowmobile that Search and Rescue had provided for him, and he pulled a radio transmitter from the compartment behind the seat. When he spoke through the mouth hole of his ski mask, his words ghosted against the radio in a cloud of white vapor. </p><p> "Unit Three to base. Over." </p><p> "This is base. Go ahead, Cork." </p><p> "I'm at Needle Lake. No sign of her. I'm going to head up to Hat Lake. That'll finish this section." </p><p> "I copy that. Have you seen Bledsoe?" </p><p> "That's a negative." </p><p> "He completed the North Arm trail and was going to swing over to give you a hand. Also, be advised that the National Weather Service has issued a severe weather warning. A blizzard's coming our way. Sheriff's thinking of pulling everybody in." </p><p> Cork O'Connor had lived in the Northwoods of Minnesota most of his life. Although at the moment there was only a dark cloud bank building in the western sky, he knew that in no time at all the weather could turn. </p><p> "Ten-four, Patsy. I'll stay in touch. Unit Three out." </p><p> He'd been out since first light, and despite the deerskin mittens, the Sorel boots and thick socks, the quilted snowmobile suit, the down parka, and the ski mask, he was cold to the bone. He put the radio back, lifted a Thermos from the compartment under the seat of the Polaris, and poured a cup of coffee. It was only lukewarm, but it felt great going down his throat. As he sipped, he heard the sound of another machine cutting through the pines to his right. In a minute, a snowmobile broke through a gap in the trees, and shot onto the trail where Cork's own machine sat idle. Oliver Bledsoe buzzed up beside Cork and killed the engine. He dismounted and pulled off his ski mask. </p><p> "Heard you on the radio with Patsy," Bledsoe said. "Knew I'd catch you here." He cast a longing look at Cork's coffee. "Got any left?" </p><p> "Couple swallows," Cork said. He poured the last of the coffee into the cup and offered it to Bledsoe. "All yours." </p><p> "Thanks." </p><p> Bledsoe was true-blood Iron Lake Ojibwe. He was large, muscular, a hair past fifty, with a wide, honest face and warm almond eyes. Although he was now an attorney and headed the legal affairs office for the tribal council, in his early years he'd worked as a logger and he knew this area well. Cork was glad to have him there. </p><p> Bledsoe stripped off his gloves and wrapped his hands around the warm cup. He closed his eyes to savor the coffee as it coursed down his throat. "Anything?" he asked. </p><p> "Nothing," Cork said. </p><p> "Lot of ground to cover." Bledsoe handed the cup back and glanced north where the wilderness stretched all the way to Canada. "It's a shame, nice girl like her, something like this." He dug beneath his parka and brought out a pack of Chesterfields and Zippo lighter. He offered a cigarette to Cork, who declined. He lit up, took a deep breath, and exhaled a great white cloud of smoke and wet breath. He put his gloves back on and let the cigarette dangle from the corner of his mouth. Nodding toward the sky in the west, he said, "You hear what's coming in? If that girl didn't have bad luck, she'd have no luck at all." </p><p> Cork heard the squawk of his radio and picked it up. </p><p> "Base to all units. It's official. We've got us a blizzard on the doorstep. A real ass kicker, looks like. Come on in. Sheriff says he doesn't want anyone else lost out there." </p><p> Cork listened as one by one the other units acknowledged. </p><p> "Unit Three. Unit Four. Did you copy? Over." </p><p> "This is Unit Three. Bledsoe's with me. We copy, Patsy. But listen. I still haven't checked Hat Lake. I'd like to have a quick look before I head back." </p><p> "Negative, Cork. Sheriff says turn around now. He's pulling in the dogs and air search, too. Weather service says it's not a storm to mess with." </p><p> "Is Wally there?" </p><p> "He won't tell you anything different." </p><p> "Put him on." </p><p> Cork waited. </p><p> "Schanno, here. This better be good." </p><p> Cork could see him, Sheriff Wally Schanno. Grim, harried. With a missing girl, a whale of a blizzard, and a recalcitrant ex-sheriff on his hands. </p><p> "I'm just shy of Hat Lake, Wally. I'm going to check it out before I turn back." </p><p> "The hell you are. Have you taken a good look behind you?" </p><p> Glancing back to the west, toward the cloud bank that was now looming high above the tree line, Cork knew time was short. </p><p> "It would be a shame to come this far and not make it that last mile." </p><p> "Bring yourself in. That's an order." </p><p> "What are you going to do if I don't? Fire me? I'm a volunteer." </p><p> "You want to stay on Search and Rescue, you'll come back now. You read me, Unit Three?" </p><p> "Loud and clear, Sheriff." </p><p> "Good. I expect to see you shortly. Base out." </p><p> Schanno sounded weary deep down in his soul. Cork knew that the sheriff would turn away from the radio to face the family of the missing girl, having just reduced significantly the chances of finding her alive. For Cork, being out there in the cold and the snow with a blizzard at his back was infinitely preferable to what Sheriff Wally Schanno had to deal with. Once again, he was exceedingly glad that the badge he himself had once worn was now pinned to the chest of another man. </p><p> "Guess that about does it," Oliver Bledsoe said. </p><p> "I'm going to check Hat Lake." </p><p> "You heard the sheriff." </p><p> "I've got to know, Ollie." </p><p> Bledsoe nodded. "You want a hand?" </p><p> "No. You go on back. I won't be more than half an hour behind you." </p><p> "Schanno'll skin you alive." </p><p> "I'll take my chances with Wally." </p><p> Cork climbed onto the seat, kicked the engine over, and shot east in a roar of sparkling powder. </p><p> He hated snowmobiles. Hated the noise, a desecration of the silence of the deep woods that was to him a beauty so profound it felt sacred. Hated the kind of people snowmobiling brought, people who looked at the woods as they would an amusement park, just another diversion in the never-ending battle against boredom. Hated the ease with which the machines allowed access to a wilderness that could swallow the ignorant and unwary without a trace. The only value he could see in a snowmobile was that it allowed him, in a situation like this, to cover a large area quickly. </p><p> By the time he reached Hat Lake, the dark wall of cloud behind him stretched north and south from horizon to horizon, completely blotting out the late afternoon sun. The sight gave Cork chills that had nothing to do with the temperature. He found no sign of a snowmobile on the trail that circled the lake. Exactly what he'd suspected, but he wanted to be certain. The wind rose at his back. He watched ghosts of snow swirl up and pirouette across the lake ice. Except for the dancing snow and the trees as they bent to the rising wind, nothing moved. Not one flicker of life across the whole, frigid face of that land. </p><p> Copyright � 2004 by William Kent Krueger</p></p><h2>My Grandmother&#39;s Stories: A Collection of Jewish Folk Tales</h2><p>&#x201c;Like all good stories in the Yiddish tradition, the pleasure of Geras&#x2019; collection comes as much from the telling as from what happens. These are stories within stories: the narrator remembers herself as a young child hearing them from her grandmother, as they cooked, hung up laundry, prepared for the Sabbath, or cleaned house for Passover. This framing of the stories emphasizes their continuing pleasure across generations; and customs, idioms, traditions, even recipes that the Jews brought with them from Eastern Europe are an unobtrusive part of the telling.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i>, Starred</p><p>Inspired by the everyday trinkets and treasures in her apartment, a grandmother tells her curious granddaughter stories based on their Russian Jewish heritage. An old tin button box reminds Grandmother about the poor farmer who outwitted a Czar. While cutting up apples for a strudel, Grandmother recalls the tale of a very rich, very greedy merchant who learned a lesson at the table of King Solomon. Choosing among carnations, gladioli, and roses in Moshe&#x2019;s flower shop makes Grandmother think of a garden of talking--and bickering--flowers. <p> This collection of 10 traditional Jewish folk tales, first published in 1990, is now gorgeously illustrated by Caldecott Honor Book recipient Anita Lobel (<i>On Market Street</i>). Author Adele Geras, who also penned the critically acclaimed young adult novel <i>Troy</i>, has captured the rhythm and cozy warmth of a loving grandmother&#x2019;s storytelling. Readers of all ages will love to curl up with the granddaughter for an afternoon of magical, wondrous shared lore.

Original.</p><p><p>JANE and MICHAEL STERN are the authors of the best-selling <i>Roadfood </i>and the acclaimed memoir <i>Two for the Road. </i>They are contributing editors to <em>Gourmet</em>, where they write the James Beard Award&#x2013;winning column "Roadfood," and they appear weekly on NPR&#x2019;s <i>The Splendid Table. </i>Winners of a James Beard Lifetime Achievement Award, the Sterns have also been inducted into the Who&#x2019;s Who of Food and Beverage in America.</p>Introduction<br><br>America is a wonderland of sandwiches. Every region, every city, every family, has its favorites, and it is rare indeed to find any two that are exactly alike. Some are austere, like the plain, perfect fried fish sandwich Coleman&#x2019;s sells in the old market of Wheeling, West Virginia; others are baroque, like the goopy, soupy hot brown of Louisville, Kentucky. There are rich ones served in tumbledown shacks: the crab roll at Red&#x2019;s Eats on the Maine shore. And there are plebeian ones made by cutting-edge chefs: liver &#x2019;n&#x2019; onions with firecracker sauce at the Old Post Office on Edisto Island, South Carolina. Sandwiches with ethnic roots abound: Italian roast pork in Philadelphia, the ubiquitous diner souvlaki, the multiple-meats, high-protein Uruguayan chivito, Nebraska&#x2019;s Russian/German meal in a pastry known as a bierock. Many sandwiches are only-in-America delights: pimento cheese throughout the South, New Mexico&#x2019;s roast green chile wrap, New Orleans&#x2019; oyster loaf, Great Lakes walleye (with beer on the side, of course).<br> You can travel coast to coast eating nothing but sandwiches, never having the same kind twice, and discover some of the most enjoyable one-of-a-kind restaurants along the way. This book&#x2019;s sandwich sources are as varied as the landscape, from the film noir sawdust floors of Philippe the Original in Los Angeles (home of the French dip) to the al fresco picnic tables of the Clam Box on Massachusetts&#x2019; North Shore. A few of our favorite recipes come from quite civilized dining establishments: chicken Vesuvio at Harry Caray&#x2019;s in Chicago; sardines on rye at the Pine Club in Dayton, Ohio; spiedini of beef at Louie&#x2019;s Backyard in Key West. A lot hail from diners (Becky&#x2019;s of Portland, Maine), street carts (Roque&#x2019;s Carnitas of Santa Fe), butcher shops (In&#x2019;t Veld Meat Market of Pella, Iowa), and bars (McBob&#x2019;s of Milwaukee).<br> For so many Americans, sandwiches are a vital part of our culinary selves, an identity marker nearly as distinct as DNA. Tell us what you call a sandwich of warm roast beef with gravy, and we will tell you where you&#x2019;re from. If you call it Italian beef, you are from Chicago. If it&#x2019;s beef on weck, you are a Buffalonian. If you ask for it with debris (succulent scraps from the roasting pan or cutting board), you are from New Orleans. Call it wet beef or beef Manhattan, and we&#x2019;d bet you live in Kansas or the western plains. Hot beef is strictly an Upper Midwest term. French dip used to be southern Californian but is now more generally western.<br> The tubular segment of bread that is sliced lengthwise and filled with cold cuts or hot meats has enough variations and aliases to make a book: hero and submarine throughout the East (except in Westchester County, New York, where inexplicably it is known as a wedge, and in much of Connecticut, where it&#x2019;s a grinder). It is nowhere more popular (or better) than in the Delaware River Valley, where the term hoagie&#x201d; supposedly began as hoggie&#x201d; because during World War I, Italian ship workers in Philadelphia&#x2019;s Hog Island became known for the gigantic sandwiches they brought for lunch. Hoagie&#x201d; usually is applied only to cold variations (although we&#x2019;ve seen hot hoagies, too). Midwestern state fairs offer a hot or cold variation of the theme as an Italian sandwich, or by its politically incorrect name, Guinea sandwich. In Portland, Maine, the word sandwich&#x201d; is redundant. Step up to the counter and order an Italian.<br> Similarly, throughout Florida, as well as in New York City, the term Cuban&#x201d; refers not only to a person from Cuba or a Havana cigar, but also to a layered sandwich that contains two kinds of pork, white cheese, pickle, and mustard inside a tube of fluffy-centered Cuban bread. Louisiana Acadians call their multilevel variant a pirogue, after the old-time bayou canoe, and in New Orleans it is a po&#x2019; boy, because back in 1929 the sandwiches were offered by French Quarter restaurateurs to striking streetcar workers, who were poor boys.&#x201d; Egalitarian-minded readers will notice that this book&#x2019;s contents are not equally balanced among states and regions. Rather than include two recipes from each of the fifty states, we have focused on what we know and love and can recommend wholeheartedly: the best sandwiches we have eaten in our travels around the country, as served at our favorite restaurants. It has long been our belief that a dish, or a sandwich, is far more interesting when you know who makes it, who invented it, who eats it, and where and how it&#x2019;s served.<br> You&#x2019;ll notice that there are no hamburgers, barbecue sandwiches, or hot dogs in this book. The omission is not because we disrespect them; on the contrary, each deserves a book of its own. The question is: are they sandwiches? They fit the most basic meaning of the term ingredients enclosed by or supported by bread but they are defined less by tttttheir sandwichness than by other, more important measures. Hamburgers are a matter of meat and condiments, and while the quality of the bun can surely make a huge difference, a great hamburger satisfies a different facet of human hunger from a great sandwich. The same goes for barbecue and hot dogs. To think of these three as sandwiches is like thinking of handguns, shotguns, and rifles as tools. Yes, they are, but if we were writing a book on the subject, we wouldn&#x2019;t think to include them along with hammers and saws.<br> Sandwiches are not uniquely American. Many of the world&#x2019;s fine cuisines have ways of neatly pocketing meat or vegetables inside breadstuffs (what would we moderns do without the Mideast&#x2019;s pita bread?). The sandwich as we know it was actually invented in England, when, two centuries ago, the fourth Earl of Sandwich ordered meat brought to him on bread so his meal wouldn&#x2019;t divert him from the gambling tables, but it&#x2019;s this country that&#x2019;s gone hog wild with the concept. Perhaps that&#x2019;s because sandwiches are, by their very nature, casual food. They are at home on a picnic table, perfect for snacks, easy to eat as well as to make at any time of day. What could be more truly, democratically American than a meal at which you don&#x2019;t have to worry about which fork to use or what wine to serve?<br> Sandwichcraft Is there anyone who cannot make a sandwich? Most of us admit to at least a few self-doubts when we have to engage in serious cooking (mixing, souffl�ing, grilling, and the like), but when it comes to sandwiches, who does not consider himself or herself a master? We all have our own version of the classics tuna, PB&amp;J, BLT, and the ever-popular what&#x2019;s-in-the-refrigerator?- on-white. But there is more to sandwichery than these comfortable fundamentals. Sandwiches can be the world&#x2019;s easiest way to create novel meals without producing a lot of unwanted kitchen heat.<br> After all, the only things you need to construct a great one are some interesting ingredients and a condiment or two. If you&#x2019;ve got the supplies, you can put a great sandwich together nearly as quickly as shuffling a deck of cards.<br> Here are a few basic guidelines for happier sandwich making and eating.<br> BREAD The exoskeleton of a sandwich can be almost any kind of bread that doesn&#x2019;t crumble too easily. The importance of the bread ranges from a plain vehicle whose purpose is little more than transporting ingredients from plate to mouth as in, say, a BLT to the raison d&#x2019;etre for a sandwich in which the ingredients play second fiddle. A good example of the latter is the traditional Cuban morning bread: a toasted length of feather-light, crisp-crusted baguette spread merely with butter. Or a hot-fromthe- oven salt bagel containing only cream cheese to cushion its saline punch.<br> There are four basic bread forms for sandwiches: the slice, the loaf, the wrap, and the roll, the last category including bagels, croissants, biscuits, and any other individually sized hunk of bread that can be sliced and stuffed. Local variations of rolls and names for them are near-infinite, including bulkies, kaisers, hard rolls, long rolls, and Ports (short for Portuguese rolls).<br> Sliced bread tends to make the most wieldy sandwiches, even for triple-deckers, because slices can be hoisted easily in one hand (or possibly two hands) and because their planar shape is generally good at containing all but the sloppiest ingredients. While crustless sandwiches are pretty, crust does serve a purpose, shoring in juicy things between the slices. As a rule, the thicker the sandwich, the more essential a sturdy crust.<br> Small loaves can be quite manageable, especially if they are not overstuffed and if the ingredients aren&#x2019;t really goopy, like an Italian Parmesan with lots of sauce. Some loaves are slightly scooped out their soft centers removed so the filling will fit better, which makes for a sandwich that is easy to pick up but still runs a high risk of disintegrating after a bite or two. The extreme example of this latter problem is the New Orleans oyster loaf, aka oyster boat, which tends to be more knife-and- fork fare than something you&#x2019;d consider eating out of hand. Some New Orleans restaurants make their oyster boats not in tubular French breads but in whole, full-size sandwich loaves, one entire loaf per sandwich!<br> A great dilemma for many bread-loving sandwich makers who use loaves, rolls, or such Italian breads as ciabatta or focaccia is that the best of them are chewy and sturdy-crusted, meaning that the firm bite required almost inevitably causes malleable ingredients like tuna salad, peanut butter, and soft cheese to squish out. The only solutions are to make mini sandwiches, deconstruct the sandwich and eat the top and bottom halves separately, or live with the drippage.<br> Every bit as much as top-quality ingredients, good bread can make or break a sandwich. Corned beef on supermarket rye cannot hold a candle to the same corned beef on slick-crusted, chewy sourdough rye. Likewise, a Delaware Valley hoagie demands to be made on a rugged length of fresh-baked Italian bread, and no matter how good the beef is in Buffalo, it is not a real beef sandwich unless the roll is a genuine kummelweck spangled with coarse salt and caraway seeds.<br><br>CHEESE Some cheese exists for sandwiches: Swiss, American, Muenster. And while provolone is fine when melted in a casserole, its true destiny is to be the rich, heat-softened blanket atop sauced meats in a hot Italian hero.<br> Modern sandwichcraft tends to include many cheeses not formerly found between sliced bread: disks of fresh mozzarella (known in all delis of the Northeast as mutz), wedges of runny Brie and triple crcme, even such unwieldy crumblers as Maytag blue and Gorgonzola.<br> The most basic use of cheese in a sandwich is as a solo act. God bless grilled cheese, even when it doesn&#x2019;t include bacon or tomato, and even if the bread is supermarket white. The balance of silky melted cheese and a crisp griddle-cooked envelope of bread around it is fundamental. (But please, let&#x2019;s at least have pickles on the side!) Likewise, we salute a thick pile of thin- sliced Swiss on fresh, crusty rye (preferably with butter and mayo) as well as the ultra-kitsch but hard-to-resist standby of Velveeta on supersoft Wonder, adorned, of course, with Miracle Whip.<br> Who doesn&#x2019;t love the classic combos: ham and Swiss, salami and provolone, roast beef and American? But there&#x2019;s also great joy to be had in mix-&#x2019;n&#x2019;-matching cheeses: American and Swiss with liverwurst, or a tuna salad patty melt topped not with a usual cold-cut companion but with see- through tiles of heat-softened hard cheese such as Parmesan or Asiago.<br> Aside from taste, the primary issue to consider when choosing cheese for a sandwich is texture. A really rugged salami requires an equally substantial cheese, lest the meat&#x2019;s chewiness totally eclipse the velvet-soft character of, say, Cheez Whiz. On the other hand, the uniformity of Whiz, especially when melted, makes it a perfect foil for the tender shreds of griddled beef in a Philly cheesesteak.<br> OTHER INGREDIENTS There are few sandwiches that don&#x2019;t benefit from a film of butter spread on the bread, not only because the flavor of butter is complementary to so many things, but also because the butter seals the bread and thus prevents moist ingredients from leaching into it and turning it soggy. Needless to say, softened butter is best for spreading, especially on soft slices, and it&#x2019;s important to spread it everywhere and all the way to the edges.<br> Consider flavored butter. Starting with slightly softened butter, you can add crushed garlic, a bit of anchovy paste, mustard, herbs, lemon juice, wasabi, or curry powder to fit the ingredients.<br> Lettuce, parsley, cilantro, and any other leafy things should be patted very dry after they are washed. Similarly, you can limit the sog factor of very juicy tomatoes by laying the slices on a paper towel before putting them into the sandwich.<br> LEFTOVERS AND LEFTOVER SANDWICHES The best-known leftovers sandwich maker is cartoon character Dagwood Bumstead, whose culinary gift is heaping an impossibly high tower of disparate leftovers between slices of bread, usually straight from the refrigerator in the middle of the night. Dagwood&#x2019;s heroic heaps of cold cuts, chicken parts, and hunks of roast gained such popculture notoriety in the 1930s that the name dagwood&#x201d; has endured as a term for any sandwich that is based on a pile of seemingly incongruent ingredients.<br> For serious fans of gravy-drenched sandwiches, leftovers are the best part of Thanksgiving dinner: day-after hot turkey sandwiches. Slices and scraps of white and/or dark meat are warmed (preferably in a microwave oven, so they stay moist) and arrayed on a couple of pieces of good soft white bread. The bread is sided by a volcano- shaped mound of mashed potatoes, either left over and reheated with a few extra shots of warm milk and butter or freshly made, and the whole shebang is blanketed with hot gravy. Like the potatoes, the gravy can be from the day before or it can be freshly made, or, when time and energy are limited, it can be store-bought. If you have some cranberry sauce from the turkey-day feast, so much the better; its sweet tang and bright red color add zest to the plate of beige leftovers that many consider the ultimate comfort food. Needless to say, this is a sandwich that demands utensils.<br> The possibilities for using leftovers in sandwiches are only as limited as your imagination. The only thing you don&#x2019;t want between the bread is something with bones (although we&#x2019;ve seen bone-in pork chop sandwiches that work). Of course, any carved hunk of meat is a natural, hot or cold: turkey, chicken, ham, beef, pork. Have a few deviled eggs left over from a party? Chop them fine and make egg salad sandwiches. Yesterday&#x2019;s roasted vegetables, layered with creamy cheese between sturdy tiles of peasant bread, are irresistible. We love thin slices of leftover meat loaf on whole wheat bread with ketchup, lettuce, and mayo.<br> Then there&#x2019;s the issue of leftover sandwiches. That is, sandwiches you&#x2019;ve made that don&#x2019;t get eaten. Well, what&#x2019;s better than ham and Swiss refrigerated overnight, then dipped in egg and griddle-cooked in plenty of butter to become a breakfast sandwich?<br> TOASTING If you like toasted sandwiches, a kitchen tool well worth having is a plancha, a sandwich press that toasts both sides and squeezes the sandwich together. It compresses the ingredients, not only making for a less messy sandwich but also creating a great harmony of multiple layers. If you don&#x2019;t have a plancha, the effect can be approximated by cooking the sandwich in a large frying pan while using a smaller one to weigh it down (and of course flipping the sandwich once).<br>SERVING Cutting a sandwich in half is almost always a good idea for easy eating. When cutting one with ingredients that are likely to squish out, consider assembling it without the top layer of bread, cutting ...</p><h2>Close to the Knives</h2><p>A collection of autobiographical essays which chart the author&#39;s life, from his violent childhood in suburbia, to his homelessness on the streets of New York City, to his eventual triumph as an artist.

Tales of gold discovered in the region's north circulate in every waterfront dive and sailor's tavern and now countless adventurers and fortune-seekers have set sail in search of riches. All these adveturers have to guide them are legends and garbled tales of the dangers that lie in wait -- hostile coasts, fields of ice, impassable barriers and strange, terrifying creatures. But all accounts concur that the people of the north meet all trespassers with the sword. And beyond are rumoured to lurk Elder monsters out of history's very beginnings. Into this turmoil ventures the mercenary company, the Crimson Guard. Not drawn by contract, but by the promise of answers: answers to mysteries that Shimmer, second in command, wonders should even be sought. Arriving also, part of an uneasy alliance of Malazan fortune-hunters and Letherii soldiery, comes the bard Fisher kel Tath. And with him is a Tiste Andii who was found washed ashore and who cannot remember his past life, yet who commands far more power than he really should. Also venturing north is said to be a mighty champion, a man who once fought for the Malazans, the bearer of a sword that slays gods: Whiteblade.<br><br>And lastly, far to the south, a woman guards the shore awaiting both her allies and her enemies. Silverfox, newly incarnated Summoner of the undying army of the T'lan Imass, will do anything to stop the renewal of an ages-old crusade that could lay waste to the entire continent and beyond. Casting light on mysteries spanning the Malazan empire, and offering a glimpse of the storied and epic history that shaped it, <i>Assail</i> is the final chapter in the epic story of the Empire of Malaz.</p><p>IAN CAMERON ESSLEMONT was born in 1962 in Winnipeg, Canada.

This revolutionary book is not a step-by-step guide on how to pray but an inspiring vision that moves people to greater hope as they see the tremendous potential of prayer. Breakthrough Prayer is peppered with amazing stories of answered prayer from the Brooklyn Tabernacle, including the story of the final survivor of the World Trade Center collapse and the prayers she prayed before becoming the last person pulled from the wreckage alive. Unique features include: * Breakthrough to Holiness: What is the connection between how we live and how we pray? * Breakthrough to Power: What are the prayers that really have power with God? * Breakthrough to Listening: How can we learn to recognize God&#39;s answers to our prayers? Jesus said and did only the things he received from the Father. When we do the same, the real potential of our lives will unfold, and prayer will enable us to become people with instructed tongues who are able to sustain others in fearful times---times much like those we face today. &#39;Voices inside my head were constantly screaming at me. I became like an animal in the street, muttering or yelling out a stream of profanity as people passed by. One day, lying in a hospital bed, close to death, I cried out, Jesus, help me! O God, you&#39;re my only hope! That was the breakthrough prayer that saved my life.&#39; --Danny &#39;Talk about breakthrough prayer! I was buried under 110 stories of steel and concrete on 9/11. But God heard my prayer for a miracle.&#39; --Genelle &#39;My husband and I had a dream of helping desperate young women. But no banker in his right mind would finance such a venture. So we prayed and God broke through every single obstacle we faced.

He is also the author of the bestselling titles Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire; Fresh Faith; Fresh Power; Breakthrough Prayer; The Life God Blesses; The Church God Blesses; and The Promise of God&#39;s Power.

Fuego Vivo, Viento Fresco, Fe Viva y Poder Fresco, reside en la ciudad de Nueva York con su esposa, Carol, quien dirige el coro del Tabernaculo de Brooklyn, ganador del premio Grammy.Prayer is an essential part of the devoted Christian's life, Cymbala (Fresh Faith) reminds readers, and the Bible sets forth numerous examples of faithful men and women who prayed constantly. In this inspirational guidebook for committed Christians, the author, the pastor of the Brooklyn Tabernacle, writes that he has seen the power and comfort of prayer not only in the Bible but in his own life, as well as in the lives of his church members, many of whom were personally affected by the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Cymbala assures that God wants to hear and answer people's prayers, and thus people should pray with "certainty" and with "confidence." He gives guidelines for making effective prayers, and suggests that only supplicants who abide by "God's spiritual laws" can expect to have their prayers answered. "An unforgiving spirit, bitterness, secret, sexual sins," he writes, "can stymie our praying." (This is the reason, he says, that he once refused to pray for a man in his Tabernacle-because he lived "in fornication" with his girlfriend.) Cymbala focuses largely on how to use prayer to become filled with joy and to cast away worries or fears, and he spends much of the book explaining how a life of faithful prayer can result in deep, lasting inner peace. Spiced with lively anecdotes-the heroin addict who found God; the disaffected young man who became a soapbox preacher-and punctuated with pullout quotations, Cymbala's impassioned message should bring encouragement to the Christian faithful. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Taps: A Novel</h2><p>Sixteen-year-old Swayze Barksdale watches from his Mississippi Delta front lawn as the tow&#39;s young men go off into the army, and when he is called to unexpected duty himself, his life becomes filled with funerals and the trajic note of the times.</p><p>"Willie Morris's last book may be his truest...a very knowing look at small town life in the 1950s." --DAVID HALBERSTAM <p>"Willie Morris lived a grand legacy, daily.

This book employs nutrition, massage, herbs, homeopathy and other medical alternatives that can not only cure you but enhance your sex life, and your physical and mental strength.</p><p>My message is simple: If you have been diagnosed with problems with the prostate, including cancer, you don't have to let the doctors give you radiation or surgically remove your prostate. There is an alternative, one that will not only eliminate your disease but also increase your general level of health. What you'll find in my book is the plan I created to heal myself naturally from prostate cancer, and attain the outstanding levels of health and vitality I enjoy today. <p>As a prostate cancer patient I became very frustrated with the lack of and conflicting answers provided by the medical establishment. Urologists say that surgical removal is the only cure, yet their own studies show a 75% relapse rate in 10 years and the side effects rate of 50% or more for incontinence and impotence was not acceptable to me. Radiation didn't feel much better and the recurrence was said to be higher. </p><p>I began intensive research and found that on a global perspective most cultures do not have prostate problems. Prostate cancer is prevalent mainly in the more highly developed countries, with France being a notable exception.What has gone wrong for men in our Western Civilization? God did not create us with prostate problems, yet many men are told by their doctors to expect to have prostate problems sooner or later. There must be a reason. Why? </p><p>My research led me to the work of the great German Professor/Scientist Dr. Otto Warburg, who won his first Nobel Prize in 1931 for proving that cancer cannot live in cells that are in pH, oxygenation balance. This fact is widely recognized in the scientific community, but seemingly not in the day to day medical practice. I also learned that no disease can live in pH balanced, oxygenated cells. This is a fact throughout nature--farmers and gardeners know crops thrive when the pH of the soil is right and do very poorly when it is off. </p><p>When I discovered that the pH of my body was highly acidic--which is true for about ninety percent of us living in industrialized countries--I set off to find out what could be done to get my body in pH balance and restore my health. </p><p>Toxins from our food, water, air, parasites and dental work all contribute to making us acidic. I learned that the ancient process of fasting could release these toxins and after several tries that had varying success, I discovered a combination of tried-and-true fasting methods and cleansing products that allowed for a fast which was easy and fun and which brought me close to the cellular pH balance that is healthy. </p><p>To monitor my progress, I used a test called the Biological Terrain Assessment (BTA), which is from Europe, and is now becoming more available in the US. The BTA measures pH, Oxidation and Resistivity of the blood, saliva and urine, rounded to 2 decimal places. With this accurate feedback I was able to strengthen weak organs with homeopathics, monitor mercury detoxification and in 6 weeks I was finally near optimum. Numerous tests confirmed that I was cancer free. But I also had an added bonus...I was feeling better with more energy than I could remember, and healthier than I was prior to the cancer. </p><p>Thus I had found a path to a level of health far above that considered by day to day medicine. This was a level free of surprises such as the cancer that "struck me out of the blue" when I was billed by my doctors as being in outstanding health. "Surprises" are unnecessary and hardly good health management. </p><p>Men are being given such poor options within the context of conventional medical treatment that I felt I had to write this book to give men, who are open to receiving them, other, more natural, possibilities to consider for treatment and prevention.</p>"This book is a must-read for anyone who has cancer of the prostate or wishes to maintain optimal prostate health. It provides the reader with a road map for the latest cutting-edge technologies in medicine. Dr. Clapp is to be commended for having the courage to seek out 2lst century medicine, and to make it available to all of us." -- MICHAEL CALITZER, M.D., THE AMERICAN HEALTH INSTITUTE <p>Each year, 40,000 American men have their prostates surgically removed or burned with radiation, often within 48 hours of cancer diagnosis. While doing so may eliminate an immediate problem, it will result in reduced quality of life, often including impotence and incontinence. And unfortunately, surgery and radiation don't work as well as claimed. Often the cancer recurs -- 35% require retreatment within five years and 75% within 10 years. Larry Clapp, Ph.D., J.D. will teach you how to: </p><p>* STOP PROSTATE TROUBLE IN ITS TRACKS using nutrition, massage, herbs, homeopathy, and other alternative healing approaches. * UNDERSTAND WHAT CAUSES CANCER, including toxins from your diet, drugs, the environment, pesticides, and parasites -- all relatively easy to change. * REVERSE THE CANCER-CAUSING EFFECTS of dental toxins from hidden infections, root canals, and the 50% mercury content in silver-amalgam fillings. * CLEANSE AND STRENGTHEN VITAL ORGANS, including your colon and prostate. </p><p>* ENHANCE YOUR SEX LIFE and become physically and mentally stronger. * VIRTUALLY ELIMINATE YOUR CHANCE FOR DISEASE by balancing your pH. The prostate is that vital center from which men derive their vitality, creative energy, and sexual drive. Without it overall health and quality of life is severely diminished. That's why it's important to take care of your prostate now, before trouble begins. Waiting for symptoms may be waiting too long. Often there are no warning signs, even in cases of advanced cancer. </p><p>Don't let them cut or fry your prostate! Larry Clapp's proven, patient-tested program can restore vigorous health in 90 days.</p></p><h2>Promise Breaker (Promise of Zion, Book 1)</h2><p>In 1947, two young people--one a Polish Jew and the other the daughter of a British major--make their way to Palestine for very different reasons and under very different circumstances.</p><p><b>Robert Elmer</b> is a graduate of St. Mary's College and Simpson College in San Francisco.

She made her film debut with Gene Kelly in the classic MGM musical <i>An American in Paris</i>, created one of the most enduring roles in American musicals as <i>Gigi</i>, danced with Fred Astaire in <i>Daddy Long Legs</i>, and starred with Cary Grant in <i>Father Goose</i>.<br><br> In <i>Thank Heaven</i> (an homage to ?Thank Heaven for Little Girls,? the song Maurice Chevalier sings about her in <i>Gigi</i>) Caron shares her remarkable life story. From her childhood with her American mother and French father in occupied France to her early success as a young ballerina; to her meeting Gene Kelly and her years in Hollywood; to her love affairs (including a very funny and very public one with Warren Beatty) and motherhood; to her alcoholism and depression; and finally her recovery and continuing success in film and television, Caron offers an illuminating account of her career.<br><br> <i>Thank Heaven</i> is filled with reminiscences of MGM at the end of its Golden Era, of the great stars with whom Caron worked, and of her own struggles as an actress. This is a sharp, unsentimental, and moving memoir for everyone who loves classic American movies.<br><br></p><p><b>Leslie Caron</b> has been nominated for two Academy Awards, for <i>Lili</i> and <i>The L-Shaped Room</i>, won an Emmy Award in 2007 for her role on <i>Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</i>, and continues to act today, starring most recently in <i>Chocolat</i> and <i>Le Divorce</i>.&#x201c;If, hovering around the tell-all memoir genre, another category exists&#x2014;such as, say, the &#x2018;tell-some&#x2019;&#x2014;then&nbsp;<i>Thank Heaven</i>, with its excellent blend of exposure and decorum, falls gracefully within it.&nbsp;Leslie Caron&nbsp;is a good writer with a volume of short stories&#x2014;<i>Vengeance</i> &#x2014;under her belt, as well as (as she puts it) &#x2018;a few scripts.&#x2019; Her concision, grace, and good taste still leave room for revelations aplenty.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Kate Light, <i>The Weekly Standard</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Caron provides countless dishy details about her exploits, which are sure to entertain film buffs, Caron fans and aspiring actors.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This is more than a typical Hollywood autobiography...

Indolent, inattentive, incurious, given to daydreaming and procrastination&#x2014;indeed, given to any excuse to remain horizontal&#x2014;Oblomov is hardly the stuff of heroes. Yet, he is impossible not to admire. He is forgiven for his weakness and beloved for his shining soul. Ivan Goncharov&#x2019;s masterpiece is not just ingenious social satire, but also a sharp criticism of nineteenth-century Russian society.<br>Translator Marian Schwartz breathes new life into Goncharov&#x2019;s voice in this first translation from the generally recognized definitive edition of the Russian original, and the first as well to attempt to replicate in English Goncharov&#x2019;s wry humor and all-embracing humanity, chosen by Slate as one of the Best Books of 2008.</p><p>The sly, subversive side of the nineteenth-century Russian literary character -- the one which represents such a contrast to the titanic exertions of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky -- was most fully realized in Ivan Goncharov&#39;s 1859 masterpiece, OBLOMOV. This magnificent farce about a gentleman who spends the better part of his life in bed is a reminder of the extent to which humor, in the hands of a comic genius, can be used to explore the absurdities and injustices of a social order.The Russian novelist IVAN GONCHAROV (1812&#x2013;1891) was born in Simbirsk, Russia. He served for thirty years as a minor government official and traveled widely. His short stories, critiques, essays, and memoirs were published posthumously in 1919. Oblomov was his most popular and critically acclaimed novel during his lifetime.<br>MARIAN SCHWARTZ has translated Russian literature for over thirty years. She has published over two dozen book-length translations, along with twenty issues of Russian Studies in Literature.

The majority of the race takes place in the Southern Ocean, where icebergs and gale-force winds are a constant threat, and the waves build to almost unimaginable heights.&nbsp;&nbsp;As author Derek Lundy puts it: "try to visualize a never-ending series of five- or six-story buildings moving toward you at about forty miles an hour." <br><br>The experiences of the racers reveal the spirit of the men and women who push themselves to the limits of human endeavor--even if it means never returning home.&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll meet the gallant Brit who beats miles back through the worst seas to save a fellow racer, the sailing veteran who calmly smokes cigarette after cigarette as his boat capsizes, and the Canadian who, hours before he disappears forever, dispatches this message: "If you drag things out too long here, you're sure to come to grief." <br><br>Derek Lundy elevates the story of one race into an appreciation of those thrill-seekers who embody the most heroic and eccentric aspects of the human condition.</p><p>The Southern Ocean is the sailor's Everest. These are unquestionably the most dangerous waters in the world: hurricane infested, frigid, wholly unpredictable, and so remote, according to Derek Lundy, that "only a few astronauts have ever been further from land than a person on a vessel in that position." Encircling Antarctica, this fearsome body of water has terrorized sailors and wrecked the ablest of ships throughout maritime history. Imagine, then, a round-the-world, single-handed sailing race of the most extreme kind--no stopping, no assistance--requiring each lone sailor to spend half the total race distance (roughly 13,000 miles) fighting this nightmarish, merciless sea. <p> The race is the Vendee Globe, and <i>The Godforsaken Sea</i> is the story of the 1996-1997 competition. Fourteen men and two women began the race in Les Sables-d'Olonne, France. Six officially finished; three were wrecked and rescued; one sailor performed emergency surgery on himself mid-race; one perished. This is high adventure of the most gripping, perilous sort, demanding a tightly controlled, suspenseful narrative: "Visualize a never-ending series of five- or six-story buildings, with sloping sides of various angles ... moving towards [the sailors] at forty miles an hour. Some of the time, the top one or two stories will collapse on top of them." But Lundy delivers more, weaving a superior fabric of psychology and physics, action and reflection. Even the utter novice will emerge understanding the architecture of racing vessels, the evolution of storms, the physical and psychological courage required to survive five-and-a half months battling the ocean alone. </p><p> Sailing aficionados may already believe that the Vendee Globe is the pinnacle of extreme sports. With Lundy's help, armchair adventurers can dig in and hang on for the ride. <i>--Svenja Soldovieri</i></p>Around the world by way of Antarctica, one boat, one sailor, no help, no stopping: these are the cruelly simple rules binding the men and women who undertake the world's most dangerous and demanding sailing race, the Vendee Globe. Godforsaken Sea is the story of the 1996-1997 Vendee Globe, a grueling four-month circumnavigation of the world via the Southern Ocean, where icebergs and hurricane-force winds are a constant threat, and the waves build to monstrous, almost unimaginable heights.<p>Through the eyes of the fourteen men and two women who embark on the race, Lundy captures both the savagery of the elements and the courage of the sailors who push themselves to the outer limits of human endeavor, even if it means never returning home. A graceful evocation of the sailing life, an eloquent meditation on danger, and an appreciation of those danger-seekers who embody the most heroic and eccentric aspects of the human condition, Godforsaken Sea is a modern classic of adventure writing, as gripping as it is insightful.</p></p><h2>The 198 (Decimation: X-Men)</h2><p>The unthinkable has happened in the Marvel Universe!

A sweeping narrative that presents a multiple biography against the flame-shot background of the American Civil War, it is the story of the great figures of the Army of Northern Virginia who fought under Robert E. Lee. </p><p> Dr. Freeman describes the early rise and fall of General Beauregard, the developing friction between Jefferson Davis and Joseph E. Johnston, the emergence and failure of a number of military charlatans, and the triumphs of unlikely men at crucial times. He also describes the rise of the legendary "Stonewall" Jackson and traces his progress in the Shenandoah Valley Campaign and into Richmond amid the acclaim of the South. </p><p> The Confederacy won resounding victories throughout the war, but seldom easily or without tremendous casualties. Death was always on the heels of fame, but the men who survived -- among them Jackson, Longstreet, and Ewell -- developed as commanders and men. <i>Lee's Lieutenants</i> follows these men to the costly battle at Gettysburg, through the deepening twilight of the South's declining military might, and finally to the collapse of Lee's command and his formal surrender in 1865. To his unparalleled descriptions of men and operations, Dr. Freeman adds an insightful analysis of the lessons learned and their bearing upon the future military development of the nation. </p><p> Accessible at last in a one-volume edition abridged by noted Civil War historian Stephen W. Sears, <i>Lee's Lieutenants</i> is essential reading for all Civil War buffs, students of war, and admirers of the historian's art as practiced at its very highest level.</p></p><p>When Douglas Southall Freeman's original three-volume version of <i>Lee's Lieutenants</i> appeared in the 1940s, it marked a high point in Civil War history, and the books were lauded not only for their scholarship but for their elegant writing. This monument of Civil War literature has been skillfully abridged by one of the most noted present-day Civil War historians, Stephen W. Sears. The new one-volume abridgement retains the core material of the original and makes Freeman's fine writing available in a much more accessible format.9 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>A Woman Soldier&#39;s Own Story: The Autobiography of Xie Bingying</h2><p>This first English translation of Xie Bingying&#39;s entire autobiography (1906-2000) is the story of a rebellious child who became a soldier, a lover, a teacher-and a writer whose bravery and determination have inspired generations of readers.

Voices United was produced in conjunction with the Hymn and Worship Resource Committee, and was edited by John Ambrose. It was published in 1996. The main pew edition of Voices United includes full words and music to more than 700 hymns by Canadian and international writers, as well as responses, psalms, scripture songs, canticles, prayers, communion settings, service music, creeds, and John Wesley&#39;s &#34;Directions for Singing.&#34; There is also a words-only edition, a music director&#39;s edition with annotations, and electronic versions. VU is the third hymnbook produced by the United Church, following the 1930 Hymnary and the 1972 Hymn Book (the latter created jointly with the Anglican Church in Canada). It includes hymns from the 1972 book, as well as some that were included in 1930 and dropped in 1972 but never abandoned by congregations. Many of the older hymns have been edited line by line and sometimes word by word, to make their language more comprehensible to modern worshippers and more applicable to the Canadian context, and to remove language that would suggest that God is male or that all of humanity is male. The expression &#34;Lord&#34;, for example, is rare in VU hymns, although it can be found, and there are also hymns that envision God in female terms. Only a few long-established hymns, those that have been in use since the 19th century, retain the archaic &#34;thou&#34; and &#34;thee&#34; and &#34;hast&#34; of traditional hymnody. The hymnal does not acknowledge or otherwise annotate edits to the original versions.</p><p></p><h2>Canada&#39;s Stonehenge: Astounding Archaeological Discoveries in Canada, England, and Wales</h2><p><p> </p>The discovery of a 5000-year-old Sun Temple and an ancient "time machine" - Stone Age calendar - in Canada led scientist Gordon Freeman to ground-breaking discoveries in Stonehenge.

The book itself is beautifully arranged and magnificently illustrated . . . Freeman is a scientist, in every sense of the term, but mostly in the oldest and truest sense . . . There are so many important insights in this book and their development for the reader is so masterful, that it almost seems inappropriate to give them short shrift in a review . . . Freeman has masterfully dispersed his teaching over the whole book, almost like a literary hologram. You can read any page, or any chapter, learn some amazing information, and enjoy the story he tells there. But it is only when the book is taken as a whole, or even on a second reading, that the complete clarity of the various insights that freeman has to impart coalesce into sharp focus . . .

Florence Adele Sloane was barely twenty when she swirled through the ballrooms of New York and Newport, cruised in the Mediterranean, and took in the sights of London and Paris. In these pages, interspersed with the commentary of Louis Auchincloss and 85 period photographs, the reader sees Adele moving through the opulence and extravagance of that privileged world: an enchantress who is like a prisoner in a gilded cage-her talent constrained by conventions, her creativity stifled by the seductive splendor of New York&#39;s Four Hundred. In the end we see her marry a rich, socially prominent young man and embark on a life we are not sure will live up to her dreams.</p><p></p><h2>Catnip: Artful Felines From The Metropolitan Museum Of Art</h2><p>From The Metropolitan Museum of Art's vast holdings comes this charming collection of fine art felines. Cats of all types provide the artistic mews for the gallery of images presented here, all perfectly paired with quips about cats from some of our most famous writers, thinkers, and humorists, among them Leonardo da Vinci, Oscar Wilde, and Gertrude Stein. The face of a cat superimposed on an artists self-portrait is accompanied by Mark Twain's dry wit: "If man could be crossed with a cat, it would improve man but deteriorate the cat." Cats have been captivating artists and thinkers for centuries, and nowhere is it more apparent than in this heartwarming homage&#x2014;from an ancient Egyptian statue of a cat, to a medieval illumination of a tiny cat sharpening its claws on the manuscript, to a Japanese painting of a cat patiently stalking a spider. This gift of a book, filled with the most exquisite portraits of cats doing what they do best, is guaranteed to enchant.</p><p></p><h2>Three Strides Before the Wire: The Dark and Beautiful World of Horse Racing</h2><p>In this meticulously researched and poignantly written narrative, Elizabeth Mitchell goes behind the scenes of one of the largest moneymaking industries in the country: horse racing. Focusing on the 1999 Derby winner Charismatic, Mitchell traces this horses amazing and ultimately tragic story, from the birth of the foal through its surprising rise to fame to its tragic death. Mitchell also follows the major players in Charismatics life, including the family who bred him, the trainer, the owners, and the famed jockey Chris Antley, whose own tragic story matches that of his horse. Through these interlocking stories, a sense of familiarity with key players in the industry evolves, as well as a greater understanding of the heart and soul of a sport that has fascinated human beings for centuries.</p><p>The day of the 20th century's final Kentucky Derby was perfectly brilliant, with a clear blue sky and pleasant, intoxicating heat. More magical than the weather, though, were the moments the Derby synthesized: the surprise victory of underdogs Charismatic and Chris Antley, and an unexpected love of racing for author Elizabeth Mitchell and her cancer-stricken companion, Chuck. The inspiration for Mitchell's engrossing <i>Three Strides Before the Wire</i> lies in those moments, when the couple's world was suddenly buoyed by the spectacular comeback of the talented but tormented jockey and the "tubby" chestnut saddled with the third-worst odds of any winner in Derby history.<p> Newly awakened to the mysterious forces at play in the sport of thoroughbred racing, journalist Mitchell retraces Charismatic's ascension from a well-bred underachiever draining his owners' bank account to a legitimate contender for the 1999 Triple Crown, a trajectory that ended with injury at the Belmont Stakes. Such a tale in horseracing is not without its personalities, and Mitchell deftly portrays the tough-as-nails trainer D. Wayne Lukas, the impassioned owners Bob and Beverly Lewis, and the gifted but drug-addled Antley, who felt an affinity for the stout colt because the first six letters of his name spelled "Chris A." <i>Three Strides Before the Wire</i> skillfully grafts history and anecdote in a rich narrative revealing both the pure glory and tough-luck hardships of thoroughbred racing, casting compassionate light on Antley's jagged path of fantastic success, drug abuse, and depression. Mitchell's astute observations of the industry's miraculous but destructive elements and the irresistible trickery of chance--which delighted her and Chuck that poignant day at the Derby--coalesce in an engaging, heart-wrenching read. <i>--Rebecca Robinson</i></p><b>Elizabeth Mitchell</b> is the author of <i>W: Revenge of the Bush Dynasty</i>.

Every day is new; every day is fraught with significance. I arrange my cup of tea, prop up my slippers. Obituaries are history as it is happening. Whose time am I living in? Was he a success or a failure, lucky or doomed, older than I am or younger? Did she know how to live? I shake out the pages. Tell me the secret of a good life!Where else can you celebrate the life of the pharmacist who moonlighted as a spy, the genius behind Sea Monkeys, the school lunch lady who spent her evenings as a ballroom hostess? No wonder so many readers skip the news and the sports and go directly to the obituary page.</p><p><em>The Dead Beat</em> is the story of how these stories get told. Enthralled by the fascinating lives that were marching out of this world, Marilyn Johnson tumbled into the obits page to find out what made it so lively. She sought out the best obits in the English language and chased the people who spent their lives writing about the dead. Surveying the darkest corners of Internet chat rooms, surviving a mass gathering of obituarists, and making a pilgrimage to London to savor the most caustic and literate obits of all, Marilyn Johnson leads us into the cult and culture behind the obituary page. The result is a rare combination of scrapbook and compelling read, a trip through recent history and the unusual lives we don't quite appreciate until they're gone.</p></p><p>Once upon a time, journalism profs duly instructed their greenhorn grads to seek out community papers and the obit pages as logical entrance points into the world of newspaper reporting. Working for cash-strapped local papers allowed novices to practice writing everything from hard news to lifestyle features. Obituaries, meanwhile, were a rung on the ladder of major publications, albeit the lowest. The musty, dusty obit pages also traditionally hosted aging reporters put out to pasture. Not any more, argues Marilyn Johnson in her unabashedly knock-kneed love letter to the obit pages, <i>The Dead Beat</i>. Today, august publications like <i>The New York Times</i>, England's <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, <i>Independent</i>, and <i>The Economist</i>, and Canada's <i>Globe and Mail</i> use exalted members of the fourth estate to turn out smart, hip tributes to widespread, almost cultish, acclaim. Why? Because, as Johnson persuasively demonstrates in her book, truth is almost always stranger than fiction and a well-written, deeply researched obit is not only a vital historical record but a damn fine read over coffee and toast. "God is my assignment editor," cracks Richard Pearson of the <i>Washington Post</i> and if that isn't more interesting than what's going on in your city council chambers, author Johnson and those working the so-called Dead Beat don't know what is. <p> As Johnson explains in free-wheeling prose, today's obit writers are virtual folk heroes with global Internet followings and their own conventions. With care and an ear for gentle humor, Johnson guides her readers through the surprisingly structured, labyrinthine obit scene, pausing to meet the writers while pondering both the essence of our being and why, in the right hands, the life of an average Joe can be just as riveting as the shenanigans of a high-flying playboy. And infinitely more resonant. Savvy J-school professors and their students are advised to take heed. <i>--Kim Hughes</i></p><p>Marilyn Johnson is a former editor and writer for <em>Life</em>, <em>Esquire</em>, and <em>Outside</em> magazines, and lives with her husband, Rob Fleder, in New York's Hudson Valley. </p></p><h2>Blind Voices</h2><p>Fantasy - One summer day in the 1920s, Haverstock&#39;s Traveling Curiosus and Wondershow rides into a small Mid-western town. Haverstock&#39;s show is a presentation of mysterious wonders: feats of magic, strange creatures, and frightening powers. Three teenage girls attend the opening performance that evening which, for each, promises love and threatens death. The three girls are drawn to the show and its performers - a lusty centaur, Angel the magical albino boy, the rowdy stage hands - but frightened by the enigmatic owner, Haverstock. The girls at first try to dismiss these marvels as trickery, but it becomes all too real, too vivid to be other than nightmare reality. Each feels the force of the show and its power to alter everyday lives: Francine is drawn embarrassingly to the centaur, Rose makes an assignation with one of the hands and gets in trouble, and Evelyn is fascinated by the pathetic, mysterious Angel, The Boy Who Can Fly, and together they plan escape. No stranger or more disturbing vision of the dark side of carnival life has been handled with such grace or conviction since Bradbury&#39;s vintage period. With a poet&#39;s mastery of language Reamy brings his circus of characters to a startling, fantastic conclusion.</p><p></p><h2>Revolution in the head: The Beatles&#39; records and the sixties</h2><p>Tracing the development of the Beatles song-by-song, this book places the group in the wider cultural context of the &#39;60s. It considers all the elements which combined to create each song as it was captured on vinyl - the songwriting process, the stimuli of contemporary pop hits and events, the evolving input from the bandmembers, the innovations pulled off in the studio and the influence of psychedelic drugs - all set against the backdrop of the era.</p><p>Ian MacDonald was born in 1948. He was Assistant Editor of the <i>New Musical Express</i> from 1972-75. He also worked as a songwriter and record producer, and is the author of <b>The New Shostakovich</b>, <b>The People&#x2019;s Music</b> and <b>The Beatles at No. 1</b>. He died in 2003.An ideal pathfinder on the Beatles' long and winding road from moptops to magi--insightful, informative, contentious, and as ambitious and surprising as its heroes. Popular music criticism is often a thankless task, falling uneasily between mindless hype and lugubrious academicism. MacDonald, former deputy editor of New Musical Express, adroitly bridges that gap, taking the factual chassis--recording session data, itineraries, etc.--laboriously assembled by Beatlemaniacs like Mark Lewisohn and bringing to bear a fan's enthusiasm, a musicologist's trained ear, and a critic's discernment to produce the most rigorous and reliable assessment of the Beatles' artistic achievement to date. Advancing chronologically through the songs, MacDonald provides an encyclopedic wealth of biographical, musical, and historical detail, yet always keeps his eyes on the prize--the uniquely rich elixir the group distilled from these disparate elements. He considers the Beatles on their own musical and cultural terms, taking his cue from contemporary influences (rhythm-and-blues, soul, and the supercharged social crucible of the '60s), rather than straining for highbrow parallels in Schoenberg or Schubert--you'll find no reference to the infamous ``Aeolian cadences'' of ``This Boy'' here. MacDonald makes no bones about his own critical convictions: He prefers the artful structures of pop, its ``energetic topicality'' that ``captures a mood or style in a condensed instant,'' to rock's ``dull grandiosity,'' a shift he attributes to a general retreat since the '60s away from depth and craftsmanship into spectacle and sensation. Accordingly, he champions the pop classicism of the Beatles' early-middle period, culminating in Revolver and Sgt. Pepper, and in his most memorably acerbic passages deplores the rockist leanings of their later work: ``Helter Skelter,'' for instance, is dismissed as ``ridiculous, McCartney shrieking weedily against a backdrop of out-of-tune thrashing.'' The ultimate Beatles Bible? Certainly a labor of love, and all the more valuable for holding the Fabs to the highest critical standards. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He tells how the beautiful South American "Queen of Cocaine" seduced the CIA into protecting her from prosecution as she sold drugs to Americans; how CIA-sponsored paramilitary ousted, tortured, and killed members of a pro-DEA Bolivian ruling party; and how the CIA created <i>La Corporacion</i>, the "General Motors of cocaine," which led directly to the current cocaine/crack epidemic.<br> &nbsp;<br> As a 25-year veteran agent for the DEA, Michael Levine worked deep-cover cases from Bangkok to Buenos Aires, and witnessed firsthand scandalous violations of drug laws by U.S. officials.</p><p><b>Michael Levine</b>, called "America's top undercover agent for 25 years," by <i>60 Minutes,</i> is the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>Deep Cover</i>, <i>The Big White Lie </i>and <i>Triangle of Death,</i> and one of the most decorated undercover agents in the history of the Drug Enforcement Administration.&nbsp; He is active as a court qualified expert and trial consultant in Covert Operations, International Narcotics Trafficking, Informant Handling and Police Use-of-Force.&nbsp; He is currently lecturing on Undercover Survival Tactics and Informant Handling for the U.S. State Department in Brazil.&nbsp; His New York City radio program, <i>The Expert Witness Show,</i> can be heard on WBAI 99.5 FM as well as Stitcher.com and iTunes.<br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>Laura Kavanau-Levine</b> is the coauthor of <i>The Big White Lie</i> and <i>Triangle of Death</i> as well as the screenplays for HBO Pictures and Deutsche Colombia Pictures. She holds an MFA from New York University and a MSW from Fordham University.Former DEA agent Levine's account of his South American sting operation to capture major cocaine traffickers--a sting, he claims, that was sabotaged by the CIA. And not only was it sabotaged, but Levine's operation allegedly precipitated the Company into supporting a revolution in Bolivia during which major dealers became high government officials. The reason for the alleged CIA betrayal? According to Levine (author of a previous expos&#x201a;, Deep Cover, 1990--not reviewed, and subject of Donald Goddard's Undercover, 1988), the agency wanted to keep Bolivia under its thumb: The poorest country in South America was the most vulnerable to Communist takeover. In the early 80's, Levine, based in Tucson, was given a new identity, a luxury house, and a ``partner,'' Sonia Attala, a past darling of the Medell�n cartel who'd made millions arranging transactions but who fled stateside when a $1.5 million deal went sour and the cartel put a bounty on her head. Levine and Attala's mission was the arrest of Bolivian Minister of the Interior Luis Arce-Gomez- -a.k.a. the ``Minister of Cocaine.'' With Levine posing as Attala's new business partner, Attala began calling her old contacts to buy DEA-seized cocaine, at which point Levine was supposed to bust the buyers. Levine's description of this undercover work is gripping as he details the tension of big bucks and kilos on the table and of cocaine cowboys--suave yet savage--making deals while drunk and cranked up, playing with their knives and guns. Moreover, the author's suspicions of the CIA's invisible hand appears confirmed by, among other suspicious disasters, having the sound wiped off of all of his incriminating videotapes of drug deals. Flawed by Levine's endless snarling and a sometime sluggish style--but undeniably the real nitty-gritty at its core.

The fastest-growing segment of the population, those beyond the age of fifty, are no longer content to simply cope with the losses of age. Mental acuity and vitality are becoming a life-long pursuit. Now, the science of the mind is catching up with the Baby Boom generation. In this landmark book, renowned psychiatrist Gene Cohen challenges the long-held belief that our brain power inevitably declines as we age, and shows that there are actually positive changes taking place in our minds. Based on the latest studies of the brain, as well as moving stories of men and women in the second half of life, <i>The Mature Mind</i> reveals for the first time how we can continue to grow and flourish. Cohen's groundbreaking theory-the first to elaborate on the psychology of later life-describes how the mind gives us "inner pushes" and creates new opportunities for positive change throughout adult life. He shows how we can jump-start that growth at any age and under any circumstances, fine-tuning as we go, actively building brain reserves and new possibilities. <i>The Mature Mind</i> offers a profoundly different and intriguing look at ourselves, challenging old assumptions, raising bold new questions, and providing exciting answers grounded in science and the realities of everyday life.</p><p><b>Gene Cohen, M.D., PH.D.</b>, is a founder of the National Institute on Aging and is currently Director of the Center of Aging, Health &amp; Humanities at George Washington University. He is the author of <i>The Creative Age</i>. Cohen has been interviewed on the Today&#x201d; show, in the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>TIME</i>, and <i>Newsweek</i>, among other programs and publications. He lives in Kensington, Maryland.*Starred Review* Never mind those "senior moments" in which a word slips away just as it&#x2019;s about to leave the lips. Cohen has good news for the over-40 set: older brains can learn new things, and they are actually better than younger brains at many types of intellectual tasks. Recent studies show that the brain and mental capacity continue to grow throughout life. This development takes advantage of a lifetime of experiences as well as the emotional mellowing that occurs with advancing age and eventuates in the older brain processing information in a manner quite different from and in no way inferior to the way a young brain performs. Cohen&#x2019;s own research establishes that both hemispheres of the brain are used more efficiently and that the brain becomes vastly more creative as life goes on. Contrary to the previous belief that new brain cells stop forming after adolescence, the former chief of the Center on Aging at the National Institutes of Health says that growing new brain cells is a lifelong phenomenon. He identifies four developmental phases of the mature brain&#x2014;midlife reevaluation, liberation, summing up, and encore; cannily supplements his data with anecdotes; and all-in-all offers a shot in the arm to the hopes of millions who wish to remain vital to the end. <i>Donna Chavez</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This is a pain more intense than childbirth, as I was told later by a woman who had enjoyed both. While they carted me down the mountain, the pain was impressive enough to make me feel perfectly okay with dying. I would have been happy to die; but as it turned out, this wouldn&#x2019;t be necessary. In a cramped, dingy emergency room, I was examined by a doctor who, by chance, was an expert in exactly my problem. I was lucky, because about a yard of my intestine was dead, and within a couple of hours I would be, too. He opened me up in an emergency surgery that saved my life. I woke up from the operation euphoric. I hugged the doctor and embraced his wife and children, grateful to his whole family for the extra chance at life he had given me. I told everyone that Chile was my new homeland, and I celebrated my new life every chance I got.<br><br>But as time passed, a persistent thought kept piercing my euphoria: What should this new life be like? This was time I was getting for free, and it seemed to call for freshness.<br><br>Not that I was unhappy. During the year I turned sixty-nine, there could hardly have been more good news coming my way. In January, I was nominated for an Oscar; in April, for a Tony; in September, for an Emmy; and in October, the first book I&#x2019;d written made the bestseller lists. All this in one year. Even my seventieth birthday came and went without a feeling of dread. I was still a kid. I still enjoyed working hard, and my appetites still called to me with the urgency of a kid&#x2019;s. We must have that dish of pasta, the food appetite would say. But this is the third dish of pasta in the same meal, I&#x2019;d tell it, secretly delighted by its roguish concupiscence. Yes, a third dish, the appetite would say, and we must have it. Now. Contented as I was, I still wanted to squeeze more juice out of my new life. This was the playful search of<br><br>a happy appetite, and I realized how lucky I was to be craving more.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve known people who didn&#x2019;t even know they wanted more, because they felt they simply had nothing. Every once in a while, I think of a moment long ago in a coffee shop in Times Square when the person sitting across from me mentioned he was thinking of killing himself.<br><br>He said it casually as he put down his coffee cup. He was a young black man, only recently out of college. I was twenty-five, and he was about twenty-two. We had met a few days earlier at a gathering of idealistic young people hoping to end nuclear testing. We had been talking about how completely dim the prospects were of our group having any success in slowing the arms race. Then our conversation turned somehow from the destruction of cities in a nuclear firestorm to the subject of his own life. That&#x2019;s when he put down his cup and said, with the air of someone announcing he was considering going off cream for skim milk, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been thinking that I might kill myself.&#x201d;<br><br>I was stunned. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t do that.&#x201d;<br><br>He looked surprised. &#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have the right to kill yourself.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course I do. It&#x2019;s my life. I can do what I want with it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, you can&#x2019;t. You can&#x2019;t do that to the people around you. You can&#x2019;t leave them with grief and a dead body. You don&#x2019;t have the right to do that to anyone.&#x201d;<br><br>He thought about that for a moment. &#x201c;Yes, I do. It&#x2019;s my body.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Look. You&#x2019;re smart, you&#x2019;re educated. You have a life ahead of you. A career.&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t even know what he did for a living, but he was smart. He&#x2019;d be able to get along in anything he chose to do.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I might go for that,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but I might kill myself. I haven&#x2019;t decided. It&#x2019;s just an option.&#x201d;<br><br>When someone&#x2019;s heading down that dark tunnel, how do you call him back? Certainly my indignation wasn&#x2019;t having any effect. I lost track of him not long after that and didn&#x2019;t find out if he ever acted on his thoughts, but I always wished I could have said something to turn him away from that darkness.<br><br>A decade later, I was surprised to be facing that same frustration. I was acting on television in M*A*S*H, and after a shaky start, the show was an enormous hit. Mail started coming in by the bagful. One afternoon, I sat in a canvas chair on the set between shots and sorted through a handful of letters. There was a note in a pink envelope, addressed to me in tiny, cramped handwriting. I opened it and started reading:<br><br>Please help me. I don&#x2019;t know what to do. I feel like killing myself.<br><br>The writer was a girl, probably a teenager. Her handwriting was neat and controlled, but her thoughts were all over the place. I was the one person, she said, who could help. Would I please write back as soon as possible with some words that would keep her from ending her life?<br><br>A few weeks later, a letter came in from a young man thinking of suicide. Then another, from someone else. There were about a dozen during the run of the show, and I answered them as well as I could. One man wrote back, saying my letter had helped him to reconsider and now he was glad to be alive&#x2014;but I wondered about the ones I didn&#x2019;t hear from. They had seemed to be looking for some kind of meaning in their lives. Had they found it?<br><br>Once the show became successful, invitations started coming in asking me to pronounce a few words to live by at college commencements and even offering honorary degrees. I instinctively recoiled. It was flattering, but flattery is the doorway to embarrassment. What did I have to say to people that was worth the time it took to listen to it? The more successful our show got, the more they asked me to come and talk. It was all out of proportion. So I went and talked. I couldn&#x2019;t resist the flattery. But I worked on those speeches with more diligence than I&#x2019;d ever used on anything before.<br><br>As my children were growing up, and later with my grandchildren, I would look for those pleasurable moments when I could call up something that would feel like passing on a little wisdom. In all of these talks, public and private, of course, I probably hadn&#x2019;t really been talking to other people. I&#x2019;m sure I was really talking to myself.<br><br>Couched in jokes and colloquial banter, my advice was always there: the pill in the pudding. But it wasn&#x2019;t such a bad pill. I was often trying to see how young people could guard themselves from a feeling later on that their lives had been a pointless passing of time. The same thing, in a way, that I was now trying to guard against myself.<br><br>I started rummaging in the back of my mind and in the bottoms of drawers for old speeches and other things I&#x2019;d said that meant something to me. And I wanted to figure out the context. What was going on in our lives then that led me to say what I said? I felt a little tingle of excitement in my belly. This would be fun.<br><br>For some reason, just before I take a look inside myself I<br><br>always think it&#x2019;s going to be fun. This is a particular form of<br><br>narcissistic madness, actors&#x2019; division. Before I knew it, I was tangled up in an unexpected and thorny question. It came at me in plain words one night, in that sullen calm before sleep. This is the calm that has two doors: One leads to dreams and the other to thoughts, and the door to thoughts is the one that goes nowhere.<br><br>With teeth scrubbed, the bathroom light switched off, and just before the light in your brain flickers out, there is a special depth to the dark. It was in that thick quiet that I heard a question move forward from the back of my head.<br><br>So tell me, the voice asked, are you living a life of meaning?<br><br>Oh, please, I thought.<br><br>No, really, said the voice. If it should happen that you don&#x2019;t wake up tomorrow, will this have been a life that meant something?<br><br>I really hadn&#x2019;t expected this. I was just looking for a little more juice. Meaning? Was this voice kidding me? Hadn&#x2019;t this year been the essence of a meaningful life? I was successful in my work. My children and grandchildren were thriving, and my wife and I had never been happier. Arlene and I were taking time to do idle, playful things on the spur of the moment. We took an afternoon off to go look at Grand Central Station, just because we hadn&#x2019;t seen it in thirty years. And then we spent an hour in the Museum of Modern Art, which we hadn&#x2019;t seen since they fixed it up. Then we walked for blocks, looking for a taxi, and when we got to Central Park and still couldn&#x2019;t get a cab, we smelled horses behind us. We turned and saw the hansom cabs lined up on Fifty-ninth Street and decided to go home by horse and carriage. We grinned for the whole trip.<br><br>It was a perfect life. So why would I wonder what the meaning of it was? But the damn question wouldn&#x2019;t go away. Once it got hold of me, it didn&#x2019;t just linger&#x2014;it pulled at my lapels, jabbed its finger in my chest. Demanded an answer.<br><br>But meaning is a tricky thing. I sat next to a young woman on a plane once who bombarded me for five hours with how she had decided to be born again and so should I. I told her I was glad for her, but I hadn&#x2019;t used up being born the first time. Nothing stopped her. She was married to an acquaintance of mine, and I couldn&#x2019;t turn her off. I left the plane with an ache in my head the size of a grapefruit. I&#x2019;m certain she led a life that was meaningful to her and had just had five meaningful hours of it. But that didn&#x2019;t mean she was living the good life. And for five hours neither was I. Fight for what you believe in, they say. Serve a high...</p><h2>Waiting For The Barbarians</h2><p><b>A modern classic by Nobel Laureate J.M. Coetzee.&nbsp;<b><b>His latest novel,&nbsp;<i>The Schooldays of Jesus</i>, is now available from Viking.&nbsp;<i>Late Essays: 2006-2016</i>&nbsp;will be available January 2018.&nbsp;</b></b></b><br><br>For decades the Magistrate has been a loyal servant of the Empire, running the affairs of a tiny frontier settlement and ignoring the impending war with the barbarians. When interrogation experts arrive, however, he witnesses the Empire's cruel and unjust treatment of prisoners of war. Jolted into sympathy for their victims, he commits a quixotic act of rebellion that brands him an enemy of the state.<p>J. M. Coetzee's prize-winning novel is a startling allegory of the war between opressor and opressed. The Magistrate is not simply a man living through a crisis of conscience in an obscure place in remote times; his situation is that of all men living in unbearable complicity with regimes that ignore justice and decency.</p><p>Mark Rylance (<i>Wolf Hall</i>,&nbsp;<i>Bridge of Spies</i>), Ciro Guerra and producer Michael Fitzgerald are teaming up to to bring J.M. Coetzee's&nbsp;<i>Waiting for the Barbarians</i>&nbsp;to the big screen.</p></p><p>Set in an isolated outpost on the edge of a great Empire, WAITING FOR THE BARBARIANS is a startling allegory of the war between oppressor and oppressed. The Magistrate, the novel&#39;s fascinating narrator, has been a loyal servant of the Empire, running the affairs of the frontier settlement, dabbling in antiquarianism, and ignoring constant reports of a threat from the &#34;barbarians&#34; who inhabit the uncharted deserts beyond the village. But when military personnel arrive with captured barbarians, he becomes witness to a cruel and unjust defense of the Empire. Outraged and, with military command controlling his village, powerless to prevent the persecution of the barbarians, he finds himself involved in an affair with one of the victims, a girl crippled, blinded, and orphaned by the torturers. Their relationship, intimate but devoid of true understanding, finally pushes him to a quixotic act of rebellion that brands him an enemy of the state. Rendered in an austere but richly suggestive prose, Coetzee&#39;s novel addresses universal political and philosophical issues of power and justice."I have known few authors who can evoke such a wilderness in the heart of man. He is an artist of a weight and depth that put him beyond ordinary comparisons...Coetzee knows the elusive terror of Kafka." -- <i>Sunday Times</i></p><h2>An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (Paul Carus Student Editions)</h2><p>A superb classroom edition with a detailed introduction and extensive notes by Anthony Flew, author of Hume&#39;s Philosophy of Belief.

The novel follows the outsize adventures of Billy Clyde Puckett, star halfback for the New York Giants, whose team has come to Los Angeles for an epic duel with the despised &#34;dog-ass&#34; Jets in the Super Bowl. But Billy Clyde is faced with a dual challenge: not only must he try to run over a bunch of malevolencies incarnate, but he has also been commissioned by a New York book publisher to keep a journal of the events leading up to, including, and following the game. Infused with Dan Jenkins&#39;s characteristic joie de vivre and replete with cigarettes, whiskey, and wild women, Semi-Tough is an uproarious romp through a lost era of professional sports that will have any armchair quarterback falling out of his or her recliner in hysterics on a semi-regular basis.</p><p>&#34;A very funny book...It is outrageous; it mocks contemporary American mores; it mocks Madison Avenue; it mocks racial attitudes; it mocks writers like me; and it even mocks sportswriters for Sports Illustrated like Dan Jenkins...[Jenkins&#39;s] writing and his ear recall--there is no higher compliment-Ring Lardner, though in different times and different Americas.&#34;A reissue of Dan Jenkins&#39;s classic football novel, which in 2002 was named #7 on Sports Illustrated&#39;s Top 100 Sports Books of All Time</p><h2>The Passing Bells: A Novel (Greville Family)</h2><p><p>Before <em>Downton Abbey</em>, there was Abingdon Pryory, the elegant country home of the Grevilles&#x2014;a titled English family who, along with their servants, see their world turned upside down when England goes to war. Once their well-kept lawns and whirling social seasons give way to the horrors of World War I, no one, upstairs or downstairs, is left untouched. For fans of sweeping historical fiction, the reissue of Phillip Rock's <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>The Passing Bells</em> is a breathtaking family saga not to be missed.</p></p><p><p>The guns of August are rumbling throughout Europe in the summer of 1914, but war has not yet touched Abingdon Pryory. Here, at the grand home of the Greville family, the parties, dances, and romances play on. Alexandra Greville embarks on her debutante season while brother Charles remains hopelessly in love with the beautiful, untitled Lydia Foxe, knowing that his father, the Earl of Stanmore, will never approve of the match. Downstairs the new servant, Ivy, struggles to adjust to the routines of the well-oiled household staff, as the arrival of American cousin Martin Rilke, a Chicago newspaperman, causes a stir. </p><p>But, ultimately, the Great War will not be denied, as what begins for the high-bred Grevilles as a glorious adventure soon takes its toll&#x2014;shattering the household's tranquillity, crumbling class barriers, and bringing its myriad horrors home.</p><p>Born in Hollywood, California, Phillip Rock lived in England with his family until the blitz of 1940. He spent his adult years in Los Angeles and published three novels before the Passing Bells series: <em>Flickers</em>, <em>The Dead in Guanajuato</em>, and <em>The Extraordinary Seaman</em>.

As such, it is also an essential reference for collectors, historians, specialists in material culture, and others who are interested in American textiles.<br><br> Published in association with the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, <i><b>American Coverlets and Their Weavers</b></i> is a work of impressive scholarship. Clarita S. Anderson has drawn upon her extensive research to identify and discuss 700 weavers and to relate details about their lives and professional careers.<br><br> In-depth discussions explore more than fifty coverlets, which are depicted in detail. Another key feature of the book is the annotated dictionary of professional American weavers of figured and fancy coverlets compiled from the University of Maryland Historic Textile Database and the research files at the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum.<br><br> Published in conjunction with the exhibition at the Folk Art Museum in Williamsburg between May 2002 and September 2003, <i><b>American Coverlets and Their Weavers</b></i> will be a treasured guide for collectors and historians alike.</p><p><b>Clarita S. Anderson</b>, noted lecturer and scholar, has written widely on textiles and is the author of <i>Weaving a Legacy: The Don and Jean Stuck Coverlet Collection</i> and <i>Figured and Fancy: Weavers of Wayne County, New York</i>.Two private collections of American handwoven coverlets, both including well-preserved examples created mostly in the Middle Atlantic states, Ohio, and Indiana between the 1810s and the 1860s, are presented in these two books. The McCarl collection is on display in Colonial Williamsburg through next year, but the Shein collection is not currently on exhibit. The coverlets, of a type known as fancy and figured coverlets, feature elaborate patterns incorporating such images as flowers, foliage, animals, government buildings, and patriotic scenes. Names of the weaver and client and the date and place of production are frequently woven into the corner blocks. The volume on the Shein collection is mainly a lovely picture book, presenting full-page photographs of both the fronts and backs of 105 coverlets. There is minimal identifying text, and a short, disjointed introduction contains some tidbits about the production of coverlets and their place in the political and social setting of the 19th century. The book on the McCarl collection presents close to 60 coverlets in full-page photographs showing their front sides, with close-up photographs of their corner blocks and a page of text for each coverlet, explaining the design motifs and summarizing what is known about the weaver. Almost half of the McCarl book is devoted to a biographical dictionary of over 700 known coverlet weavers, including information about extant coverlets believed to be theirs and the historical record of their lives. Both books contribute additional examples to the coverlets that have been documented in a number of previous volumes, while the McCarl book includes a unique addition in the biographical dictionary. Providing a good overview of the artistic range and the current appeal of these historical coverlets, these beautiful books are suitable for public libraries and specialized collections.<br><i>Kathryn Wekselman, M.Ln., Cincinnati</i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>What If Jesus Had Never Been Born?

But the ground was still bare, the grass tawny, with a few last leaves fluttering over it. The trees were shaking dark branches against a grey sky.</p><p>Any snow? Suzy asked. Suzys my little sister. Shes only four, and Ive just turned seven. I can read. Of course, so can John. Hes ten. I answered, Not a smidgin. And the sky isnt white enough for snow today. But it doesnt matterits the first day of December!</p><p>One of the reasons we love December so is Christmas, not only that Christmas is coming, but that wedo something special every single day of the month to prepare for the twenty-fifth day.</p><p>John was up and out of the house before Suzy and I were dressed. He has a paper route, every morning before breakfast, and hes allowed to ride all over the village on his bike. Im the middle Austin and the ugly duckling. If I had more time to remember and think about it, Id be very sad. Im skinny and as tall as the eight-year-olds and my legs are so long I keep falling. And I was awake early because this was a specially special December for me. I was to be the angel in the Pageant at church on Christmas Evethe biggest and most wonderful thing thats ever happened to me. I was to wear a golden halo and a flowing white costume and wings, the loveliest wings anyone could imagine. Mother made them.</p><p>Suzy is four and shes the baby and all cuddly and beautiful and her hair is curly and the color of sunshine. She has great shining eyes that are the purple-blue of the sky just after sunset. She has a rosebud for a mouth, and she isnt skinny; shes just right.</p><p>We dressed quickly, because even if there wasnt any snow it was cold, and we ran downstairs just as John came in from delivering his papers, his cheeks shiny-red as apples from the cold. The dogs came running in after him, barking: Mr. Rochester, our big brindle Great Dane, and Colette, our little silver poodle. Theyre very good friends.</p><p>Our kitchen is a big wandery room that turns corners and has unexpected nooks and crannies. In the dining room section in the winter the fire crackles merrily, and this morning the smell of applewood mingled with the smell of pancakes and maple syrup and hot chocolate. One of the cats was sleeping, curled up on a cushion in front of the fire. Our father had already had his breakfast and gone out; hes a doctor and Mother said hed gone out several hours ago to deliver a baby.</p><p>At that we looked at Mother, and the lovely bulge in her dress, and Mother smiled and said, Daddy thinks the baby should come along sometime the first week in January.</p><p>And then I wont be the baby anymore! Suzy said. And Ill help you with the new baby.</p><p>Suzys mind flits from thought to thought, just as she herself does, like a butterfly. Now she asked, Whats the surprise for the first day of December?</p><p>It wasnt completely a surprise, because each year its an Advent calendar, but its partly a surprise, because its always a new one. Advent means coming, and its the four weeks that lead up to Christmas. Mother and Daddy read serious things in the evening, and talk about them, a book called The Four Last Things, for instance.</p><p>This year the calendar was a beautiful one, and had come all the way across the ocean, from Denmark. We take turns every day opening one of the windows to see what surprise picture is waiting behind. The twenty-fourth day, when the windows open, they reveal the stable, and Mary and Joseph and the baby.</p><p>Today Suzy opened, because shes the youngestand goes first. Inside was a baby angel, who looked just like Suzy.</p><p>The next day, the second day of December, we all, even John, even Daddy when he got home from the office, made Christmas cookies. Wed better make them early this year, just in case.</p><p>Just in case the baby comes earlier than expected.</p><p>Mother added, Babies have a way of keeping mothers too busy for Christmas cookies.</p><p>I was born at the end of November, so Mother didnt make any Christmas cookies that year. I always seem to spoil things. I looked out the long kitchen windows at the mountains, thinking: Please, dont let me spoil anything this year. Dont let me spoil the Christmas Pageant. Help me to be a good angel. Please.</p><p>On the third day of December, after the school bus had let John and me off at the foot of the hill and wed trudged up the road to our house, Mother got wire andempty tin cans and a few Christmas tree balls. She took strong scissors and cut the tops and bottoms of the cans so that they made stars and curlicues.</p><p>Then we took thread and hung the Christmas balls and the tin designs on the wire, and Mother and John balanced it, and we had made the most beautiful Christmas mobile you could possibly imagine. John got on the ladder and hung the mobile in the middle of the kitchen ceiling, and it turned and twirled and tinkled and twinkled.</p><p>The next day we looked for snow again, but the ground stayed brown, and the trees were dark against the sky. When we went out through the garage to walk down to the school bus, we looked at the big sled, at Daddys snowshoes, at our ice skates hanging on the wall, at the skis. But though the wind was damp and we had on our warm Norwegian anoraks, we knew it wasnt cold enough for snow. The pond had a thin skin of ice, but not nearly enough for skating, and all that came down from the heavy grey skies was an occasionaldrizzle that John said might turn into sleet, but not snow.</p><p>And the days sped into December, On the fourth day Daddy put a big glimmering golden star over the mantelpiece in the living room. On the fifth day we taped a cardboard Santa Claus with his reindeer up the banisters of the front stairs; it came from England and is very bright and colorful.</p><p>On the sixth day we strung the merry Norwegian elves across the whole length of the kitchen windows, and Mother said that our Christmas decorations were a real United Nations. On the seventh day we put a tall golden angel above the kitchen mantelpiece. Unlike the Advent calendar angel, this one was much too stately and dignified to look like Suzy, and I sighed because I knew that even with a costume and wings, I could never hope to look as graceful and beautiful as the golden angel.</p><p>On the eighth day of December I was late getting home because the rehearsal of the Pageant lasted much longer than usual. And it lasted longer because the director couldnt get me in a position that satisfied her. The most awful moment was when I heard her whisper to the assistant director, Ive never seen a seven-year-old be so awkward or ungraceful, but I suppose we really cant recast the angel now.</p><p>I clamped my teeth tight shut to try to keep from crying, and the director said, Dont look so sullen, Vicky. An angel should be joyful, you know.</p><p>I nodded, but I didnt dare unclench my teeth. One tear slipped out and trickled down my cheek, but I didnt think anybody saw.</p><p>When the rehearsal was over, Mr. Quinn, the minister, drove me home. He hadnt seen the rehearsaland he kept talking about how the Pageant was going to be the best ever, and that I was going to be a beautiful angel. If hed been at the rehearsal he wouldnt have said that.</p><p>The Advent surprise for that day was to have the Christmas mugs at dinner, the mugs that look like Santa Claus. But I still felt like crying, and the cheerful Santa Claus face didnt cheer me up at all. After we had baths and were in our warm pajamas and ready for bed, we stood around the piano singing Advent carols, but I had such a big lump in my throat that I couldnt sing.</p><p>Daddy put his arm around me. Whats the matter with my girl?</p><p>Two tears slipped out of my eyes, and I told him about the rehearsal and what the director had said. He told me that he and Mother would help me to look and move more like an angel. You can be a lovely angel, Vicky, but youll have to work at it.</p><p>Ill work. I promise.</p><p>On the ninth day of Advent we hung the Christmas bells from the beams in the living room, and then Mother worked with me on being an angel. She had me walk all over the house with a volume of the encyclopedia on my head. When I was finally able to walk all around without the encyclopedia falling, Mother showed me how to stand with my feet in ballet position, and how to hold my arms so they didnt look all elbows.</p><p>On the tenth day of December Mother got the cuddly Santa Claus doll out of the attic, and told Suzy and me we could take turns taking it to bed at night. I thought of the Pageant, and said, Suzy can have it. May I take the Shu to Sub volume of the encyclopedia to bed with me?</p><p>Mother understood. Yes. And now put it on your head and try walking up the front stairs and down the back stairs.</p><p>Each time I did it I managed more steps without having to catch the encyclopedia. Suzy went to bed with the cuddly Santa Claus doll. I put the Shu to Sub volume under my pillow.</p><p>On the eleventh day the director beamed at me and said, That was much better, Vicky. I think youre going to be all right after all. Now lets try it again. Good, Vicky, GOOD.</p><p>I was happy when I got home and Mother gave me a hug, and John said, I dont know why anybody ever thought you couldnt do it. I knew you could.</p><p>Suzy jumped up and down and said, Whatre we going to do for Advent today?</p><p>Mother suggested, Lets make a Christmas chandelier. We took the wire mesh lettuce basket and filled it with the Christmas decorations that were just a tiny bit broken but not shattered. We hung one of the prettiest, shiniest decorations on the bottom of the lettuce basket, and then Mother and John fitted the basket over the front hall light so that it glittered and sparkled with the color of all the Christmas baubles.</p><p>And I walked up and down the front hall with the encyclopedia, Shu to Sub, balanced on my head; I tried to look at the Christmas chandelier out of the corner ...</p></p><h2>20 Master Plots and How to Build Them</h2><p>Identifies and analyzes twenty common plots, including revenge, rivalry, adventure, maturation, and love, discusses physical and character plots, and offers advice for developing a story</p><p></p><h2>Beyond Modern Sculpture: The Effects of Science and Technology on the Sculpture of This Century</h2><p>Examines the materialistic and psychological factors responsible for dominant trends in twentieth-century sculpture</p><p></p><h2>Dangerous Tastes: The Story of Spices (California Studies in Food and Culture)</h2><p>Spices and aromatics&#x2014;the powerful, pleasurable, sensual ingredients used in foods, drinks, scented oils, perfumes, cosmetics, and drugs&#x2014;have long been some of the most sought-after substances in the course of human history. In various forms, spices have served as appetizers, digestives, antiseptics, therapeutics, tonics, and aphrodisiacs. <i>Dangerous Tastes</i> explores the captivating history of spices and aromatics: the fascination that they have aroused in us, and the roads and seaways by which trade in spices has gradually grown. Andrew Dalby, who has gathered information from sources in many languages, explores each spice, interweaving its general history with the story of its discovery and various uses.<br><br>Dalby concentrates on traditional spices that are still part of world trade: cinnamon, cloves, ginger, pepper, saffron, and chili. He also discusses aromatics that are now little used in food but still belong to the spice trade and to traditional medicine: frankincense, myrrh, aloes-wood, balsam of Mecca. In addition, Dalby considers spices that were once important but that now are almost forgotten: long pepper, cubebs, grains of Paradise.<br><br><i>Dangerous Tastes</i> relates how the Aztecs, who enjoyed drinking hot chocolate flavored with chili and vanilla, sometimes added annatto (a red dye) to the drink. This not only contributed to the flavor but colored the drinker's mouth red, a reminder that drinking cacao was, in Aztec thought, parallel with drinking blood. In the section on ambergris, Dalby tells how different cultures explained the origin of this substance: Arabs and Persians variously thought of it as solidified sea spray, a resin that sprung from the depths of the sea, or a fungus that grows on the sea bed as truffles grow on the roots of trees. Some Chinese believed it was the spittle of sleeping dragons. Dalby has assembled a wealth of absorbing information into a fertile human history that spreads outward with the expansion of human knowledge of spices worldwide.</p><p>"Delightful and complex. When Dalby blends the spices, the result is unique and irresistible."&#x2014;Alan Davidson, author of <i>The Oxford Companion to Food</i><b>Andrew Dalby</b> is a historian and linguist and has written for numerous food history and classics journals.

Yet this painter, who is still popular more than a century after his death and was a powerful member of the art world of his day, was in fact obsessively private about his artistic vision. Moreau's solitary pursuit of a painting style that he termed <i>peinture �pique</i> ("epic painting") stood in opposition to contemporary trends of academic naturalism and impressionism. The artist carefully researched the elements in each of his paintings, but was motivated too by a quest for "the infinite" in art--that which cannot be put into words, the sublime. His use of brilliant, jewel-like colors, sensitively rendered gestural drawing, and complex compositions helped him both to depict an ideal world and explore the salient issues of his times--morality and the foibles of earthly existence among them.<p> <i>Between Epic and Dream</i> was published in conjunction with the first full retrospective of Moreau's work, presented during the spring and summer of 1999 at the Art Institute of Chicago and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, after the centennial of his death. Three informative essays investigate the painter's interest in Indian and Persian culture as well as other historical eras such as the Middle Ages and the Italian Renaissance. A fourth essay examines Moreau's relationship to the symbolist movement, upon which his work would have a profound influence. At a substantial 308 pages, this stunning cloth-covered hardback displays over 200 of Moreau's masterpieces and lesser-known works in 162 color plates and 129 duotone images. <i>--A.C.

Overcoming prejudice and hatred, Charley Pride has won the hearts of country music listeners and has garnered fantastic acclaim, winning three Grammys and selling more than 30 million records in the U.S. alone. Photos.</p><p>The list of black country music artists is a short list topped by Charley Pride. Born to a Mississippi sharecropper&#39;s family, he integrated Nashville in the 1960&#39;s. This was an accident, of course--he was trying to get into major league baseball! In this autobiography, Pride also describes his manic-depression and alludes to an alcohol problem. A singer, not a reader, Pride&#39;s delivery is less polished than the autobiographical readings of Reba McEntire (AudioFile 9/94) and Naomi Judd (AudioFile 4/94). He articulates articles painfully and sounds out some polysyllabic words. With no music or sound effects, this read is brutally honest and refreshingly authentic. D.W.K. (c)AudioFile, Portland, MaineThe first black country music star spins a great life story. Charley Pride, one of 11 kids born into Mississippi Delta poverty, may be the only black country star, but he's no Uncle Tom. He frankly describes growing up in a segregated world, with a tough-as-nails father and a mother he adored, writing with simple directness and folksy turn of phrase (``You have to walk past a lot of woodpiles...but most of them do not harbor wild animals''). He speaks movingly about race relations and indignities endured early on, including seeing a brother kidnapped by whites. Pride actually set out to become a professional baseball player; slowed by injuries, he still managed to become a star in the Negro Leagues and flirted with the majors. He stumbled into country music--which he had loved from childhood--almost as an afterthought. But he's had a surprisingly smooth ride there and sees his acceptance by country's white audiences as proof that music lowers barriers. Like baseball's Jackie Robinson, Pride had the right combination of traits for a pioneer: good looks, charm, and talent. He tells how RCA set up his career (developing a following for him on radio before letting fans learn he was black), and of aid and friendship proffered by Chet Atkins, Willie Nelson, Ralph Emery, and others. As with many celebrity stories, the tale of Pride's gritty beginnings is more interesting than details of his finances, his interest in astrology, or the obligatory star-chat of later chapters. Pride's story flags only slightly as he describes a struggle with manic depression, a campaign to gain respect from a withholding father, and his disappointment with the way country has abandoned its elder statesmen for vacuous, photogenic young stars. Filled with wit and grit, an admirable exemplar of the celebrity bio genre. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Amidst the numerous riffs on the Christmas story (often from the point of view of an animal) comes this straightforward, dramatic revisioning of St. Luke's gospel. The first page, which shows a Roman soldier nailing Caesar's decree to a door, plants the story squarely in a particular time and place. Bernardin's paintings, focusing tightly on the essentials laid out in the text, capture the shepherds amazement when an angel appears and their utter joy at the sight of the baby. The angel is no winged cherub creature but a large figure with arms outstretched, shining and magnificent. The story continues with a segment often left out of books: the shepherds spread the word of what they've seen, and Mary "kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart." The realistic art is the strong suit here: Jesus looks like a newborn, and Mary, serene and overwhelmed by love, seems made of flesh and blood.

Here at last is a book which allows some of them to speak for the first time. Gordon Welchman was one of the Park&#x2019;s most important figures. Like Turing, his pioneering work was fundamental to the success of Bletchley Park and helped pave the way for the birth of the digital age. Yet, his story is largely unknown to many. His book, The Hut Six Story, was the first to reveal not only how they broke the codes, but how it was done on an industrial scale. Its publication created such a stir in GCHQ and the NSA that Welchman was forbidden to discuss the book or his wartime work with the media.<br><br>In order to finally set the record straight, Bletchley Park historian and tour guide Joel Greenberg has drawn on Welchman&#x2019;s personal papers and correspondence with wartime colleagues which lay undisturbed in his son&#x2019;s loft for many years. Packed with fascinating new insights, including Welchman&#x2019;s thoughts on key Bletchley figures and the development of the Bombe machine, this is essential reading for anyone interested in the clandestine activities at Bletchley Park.</p><p>Joel Greenberg is an author and historian who researches and writes about signals intelligence and its impact on two world wars.

There is no doubt that the most high profile of these operatives was Alan Turing, who featured in the recent brilliant film The Imitation Game, starring Benedict Cumberbatch; and various news items on our local news have featured interviews with old ladies who once worked on the codes at Bletchley Park, people who were not even allowed to tell their closest family members what they were doing. Joel Greenberg's bookabout Gordon Welchman reveals a man equally as fascinating equally as important as Turing, and tells us even more about what went on in this most secret of establishments during the war years."

Yet for all her aura of public glamour, Georgiana&#39;s personal life was fraught with suffering brought on by her compulsive gambling, which led to insurmountable debts and ignominy, and her search for love, which caused misery and exile. &#34;Georgiana&#39;s World&#34; is the illustrated version of Amanda Foreman&#39;s bestselling biography, &#34;Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire&#34;, and brings a fresh perspective to her life and times. Filled with images of the people and places she actually knew, a series of special features explore such aspects of 18th-century life as aristocracy.</p><p>Amanda Foreman was born in London in 1968. A graduate of Sarah Lawrence College, New York, she has a DPhil in history from Oxford University. Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire won the 1998 Whitbread Prize for Best Biography.

Babeuf and the newspaper he edited, <i>Le Tribun du Peuple</i>, pushed well beyond his contemporaries in their staunch defense of democracy and demands for the abolition of private property. Going so far as to call for an insurrection against the government of the Directory as it increased its repression against domestic agitators, Babeuf was eventually arrested and executed in what became known as the conspiracy of equals.&#x201d;<br><br>This study of Babeuf as a political thinker, based on an analysis of his extensive writings, and on scholarship unavailable in English, draws out why so many considered him to be a major precursor of the modern revolutionary socialist tradition and goes on to make the case that his ideas have much to teach today&#x2019;s activists. The first part traces Babeuf's political evolution in the context of the French Revolution, the second examines his changing reputation among subsequent historians, and the final section assesses the originality of his thought, showing him to be neither a Jacobin nor a Utopian.<br><br>This updated second edition features an important new introduction by Ian Birchall, a prolific writer and leading authority on Babeuf, that summarizes Babeuf&#x2019;s historical significance, his ideas, and his practice in revolutionary France.<br></p><p><b>Ian Birchall</b> is a socialist historian and translator based in London.

But with these changes have come the strains and tensions of conflicting interests, desires, and values within the community. John Dewey, one of America&#39;s most prolific writers of popular philosophy, believed that humankind could keep a firm hold on its destiny only if the critical intelligence of scientific method and its democratic counterpart were emphasized and promoted. Freedom of inquiry, tolerance of diverse ideas and opinions, cultural pluralism, free speech, and a willingness to cooperate in pursuit of shared values and ideals would be the springboard for social development.</p><p>John Dewey (1859-1952) authored more than two dozen books and scores of articles in both scholarly and popular publications. He rightly deserves the title of America&#39;s foremost philosopher and his work will influence intellectuals throughout the world for many years to come.</p><h2>The Complete Stories of Evelyn Waugh</h2><p><b>A "lavishly entertaining" (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>) distillation of Waugh's genius--abundant evidence that one of the twentieth century's most admired and enjoyed English novelists was also a master of the short form.</b><br>Evelyn Waugh's short fiction reveals in miniaturized perfection the elements that made him the greatest satirist of the twentieth century. The stories collected here range from delightfully barbed portraits of the British upper classes to an alternative ending to Waugh's novel <i>A Handful of Dust;</i> from a "missing chapter" in the life of Charles Ryder, the nostalgic hero of <i>Brideshead Revisited, </i>to a plot-packed morality tale that Waugh composed at a very tender age; from an epistolary lark in the voice of "a young lady of leisure" to a darkly comic tale of scandal in a remote (and imaginary) African outpost.</p><p>Mordant, mirthful, and unrelenting in their lampoon of aristocratic mischief, Evelyn Waugh's novels have earned him a permanent place in the literary pantheon. But this cantankerous master--the scion, by the way, of a decidedly middle-class family of publishers and writers--was no less adept when it came to the short form. Indeed, Waugh first broke into print in 1926 with "The Balance: A Yarn of the Good Old Days of Broad Trousers and High Necked Jumpers," an early story that suggests a modernized and misanthropic P.G. Wodehouse. And he continued to write short fiction throughout the rest of his career, all of which has now been collected in the delectable <i>Complete Stories of Evelyn Waugh</i>. <p> The first few entries in the collection capture a kinder, gentler author, not yet red at the verbal tooth and claw. But by 1932, when he wrote "Love in the Slump," Waugh's eye for the black-comic detail was firmly in place: </p><blockquote> It rained heavily on the day of the wedding, and only the last-ditchers among the St. Margaret's crowd turned out to watch the melancholy succession of guests popping out of their dripping cars and plunging up the covered way into the church.... A doctor was summoned to attend the bridegroom's small nephew, who, after attracting considerable attention as a page at the ceremony by his outspoken comments, developed a high temperature and numerous disquieting symptoms of food poisoning. </blockquote> Waugh's wit only sharpened throughout the succeeding decades, and the very texture of his prose thickened (although it never took on much in the way of modernist adipose tissue). In "Compassion," a 1949 tale that belies the author's vaunted anti-Semitism, a mere glimpse of some Yugoslavian partisans leads to this superabundant sentence: "He passed ragged, swaggering partisans, all young, some scarcely more than children; girls in battle dress, bandaged, bemedalled, girdled with grenades, squat, chaste, cheerful, sexless, barely human, who had grown up in mountain bivouacs, singing patriotic songs, arm-in-arm along the pavements where a few years earlier rheumatics had crept with parasols and light, romantic novels." Nobody can accuse Waugh of squishy sentimentality--remember, romantic prose is strictly for convalescents. Still, <i>The Complete Stories</i> offers an accurate and stupendously entertaining vision of human folly, no less effective for being administered in smaller doses.Evelyn Waugh (1903-1966), whom <i>Time</i> called "one of the century's great masters of English prose," wrote several widely acclaimed novels as well as volumes of biography, memoir, travel writing, and journalism. Three of his novels, <i>A Handful of Dust, Scoop, </i>and<i> Brideshead Revisited,</i> were selected by the Modern Library as among the 100 best novels of the twentieth century.</p><h2>How to Write Short: Word Craft for Fast Times</h2><p><strong>America's most influential writing teacher offers an engaging and practical guide to effective short-form writing.<br></strong><br>In HOW TO WRITE SHORT, Roy Peter Clark turns his attention to the art of painting a thousand pictures with just a few words.

This is cut short when he is summoned to Portsmouth to bear witness at the trial of Sir Home Popham for his actions at Cape Town and Buenos Aires. Kydd confides in friends his true feelings about the way his old commander was treated and, when his opinions become public, finds himself in hot water with the Admiralty. Kydd is punished for his indiscretion by being given a different command: a mutiny ship, Tyger, moored at Yarmouth. On board he faces numerous challenges from a hostile and dejected crew, still under a malign influence. It will take all of Kydd&#39;s seamanship and leadership in voyages to the far north and in Baltic waters to turn the ship around.

For a true interpretation of the first and last things, we must turn to those teachers who beheld the beginning and end in a state of divine vision. Among these great seers was St. Symeon the New Theologian (949 1022): he speaks of the mysteries of the beginning and end precisely because he has seen them.</p><p>St. Symeon s profound homilies on Adam and the future age give the theological foundation for the Christian life of struggle. The original state of man from which Adam fell tells of our deepest nature, of which our present fallen nature is a corruption that is to be overcome; and the future state of blessedness is the goal to which our Christian struggle is aimed, and to which we can attain, by God s grace, despite our fallen state.</p><p> These homilies of St. Symeon have been selected, translated, and introduced by Fr. Seraphim Rose with the aim of reconnecting modern man with the ancient understanding of the true purpose of life.</p></p><p>Adam did not wish to say, &#39;I sinned,&#39; but said rather the contrary of this and placed the blame for transgression upon God Who created everything &#39;very good,&#39; saying to Him, &#39;The woman whom Thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree and I ate.&#39; And after him, she placed the blame on the serpent, and they did not wish at all to repent and beg forgiveness of Him.&#34;</p><h2>The Problem with Evangelical Theology: Testing the Exegetical Foundations of Calvinism, Dispensationalism, and Wesleyanism</h2><p><p>There is no doubting the legacy of the Protestant Reformers and their successors. Luther, Calvin, and Wesley not only spawned specific denominational traditions, but their writings have been instrumental in forging a broadly embraced evangelical theology as well. In this volume, Ben Witherington wrestles with some of the big ideas of these major traditional theological systems (sin, God's sovereignty, prophecy, grace, and the Holy Spirit), asking tough questions about their biblical foundations. Witherington argues that evangelicalism sometimes wrongly assumes a biblical warrant for some of its more popular beliefs, and, further, he pushes the reader to engage the larger story and plot of the Bible to understand these central elements of belief.</p></p><p><p>Ben Witherington III is Professor of New Testament for Doctoral Studies, Asbury Theological Seminary. His publications include <i>Troubled Waters: Rethinking the Theology of Baptism</i> (2007), <i>Making a Meal of It: Rethinking the Theology of the Lord's Supper</i> (2007), <i>The Living Word of God: Rethinking the Theology of the Bible</i> (2007), <i>What's in the Word: Rethinking the Socio-Rhetorical Character of the New Testament</i> (2009), and <i>The Problem with Evangelical Theology: Testing the Exegetical Foundations of Calvinism, Dispensationalism, Wesleyanism, and Pentecostalism, Revised and Expanded Edition</i> (2015).</p><p>Evangelicals of all stripes need to take account of Witherington's contentions here&#x2015;to make us exegetically honest and theologically responsible. He takes on the three streams of evangelicalism: Reformed, Wesleyan, and Dispensationalist views to examine their exegetical foundations and theological structures. The result is critique, but also a call for biblical orthodoxy and proclamation of biblical truth in postmodern society. His perspectives should gain a wide hearing.</p> (Donald K. McKim, Editor, <i> Encyclopedia of the Reformed Faith</i>)<br><br><p>Ben Witherington reminds us that being Reformed is a continual process. He calls Evangelical Christians to a fresh look at their claim to take Scripture seriously. Few scholars are better placed to do so. Witherington is authoritative and writes here with his usual compelling style.</p> (Trevor Hart, Principal of St Mary's College and Head of the School of Divinity, University of St Andrews)</p><h2>Why We Were In Vietnam</h2><p>Analysis of Vietnam conflict as act of idealism</p><p></p><h2>First Things First Every Day: Daily Reflections- Because Where You&#39;re Headed Is More Important Than How Fast You Get There</h2><p>The innovative time-management principles and techniques introduced in First Things First are presented in an easy-to-use format for daily inspiration, combining insights with effective methods for overcoming bad habits and focusing on people rather than schedules.

Thomas Jefferson wrote the founding documents of the United States. Thaddeus Kosciuszko was a hero of the American Revolution and later led a spectacular but failed uprising in Poland, his homeland. Agrippa Hull, a freeborn black New Englander, volunteered at eighteen to join the Continental Army. During the Revolution, Hull served Kosciuszko as an orderly, and the two became fast friends. Kosciuszko's abhorrence of bondage shaped histhinking about the oppression in his own land. When Kosciuszko returned to America in the 1790s, bearing the wounds of his own failed revolution, he and Jefferson forged an intense friendship based on their shared dreams for the global expansion of human freedom. They sealed their bond with a blood compact whereby Jefferson would liberate his slaves upon Kosciuszko's death. But Jefferson died without fulfilling the promise he had made to Kosciuszko-and to a fledgling nation founded on the principle of liberty and justice for all.</p><p><b>Gary B.

It also provides a surprisingly disappointing perspective on Jefferson's failure to deliver on the pledge to Kosciuszko to free the Virginian's slaves with Kosciuszko's bequest entrusted to his great American friend." -- <i>Zbigniew Brzezinski, author of <i>Second Chance</i> and Counselor and Trustee at the Center for Strategic and International Studies</i><br><br>"At the intersection of three remarkable lives, Gary Nash and Graham Hodges have pieced together an extraordinary tale of heroism and tragedy, trust and betrayal. <i>Friends of Liberty</i> is telling history with deep meaning for anyone interested in the burning question of slavery and race in the early American Republic." -- <i>Ira Berlin, Distinguished University Professor of History, University of Maryland, and author of <i>Many Thousands Gone</i> and <i>Generations of Captivity</i></i><br><br>"By interweaving three lives of the American Revolution, Nash and Hodges offer a fascinating account of that era from the "top down" and "bottom up," and make clear the way the struggle for independence unleashed radical hopes yet failed to solve the gravest contradiction in American life, the coexistence of slavery and freedom." -- <i>Eric Foner, DeWitt Clinton Professor of History at Columbia University, and author of <i>The Story of American Freedom</i> and <i>Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution</i></i><br><br>"Revolutionary fervor, patriotism, and heroism are not limited to one particular race, class, or nation. After reading Nash and Hodges's account of the intersecting lives and ideas of Jefferson, Kosciuszko, and Hull, it is difficult to believe that anyone could have ever thought they were. This is a dazzling account of three colorful figures whose lives are emblematic of all the many-colored threads that run through the American tapestry, and whose lives were devoted to the service of the ideals that founded our nation." -- <i>Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Alphonse Fletcher University Professor, Harvard University</i><br><br>"Using the lives of people as seemingly disparate as a president of the United States, a Polish hero of revolutions on two continents and a free black man in America to frame their story, Gary Nash and Graham Hodges have fashioned a fast-paced, informative narrative that sheds fresh light on the complicated issues of slavery, serfdom and basic human rights during the first generation of America's national existence. The linchpin in this triumvirate was the Pole Tadeusz Kosciuszko whose enlightened relationship with his black orderly, Agrippa Hull, and close friendship with Thomas Jefferson allows the authors to move skillfully between such varied discussions as explaining the black experience in colonial and Revolutionary America, the slavery issue in the early American republic, serfdom in Poland, and the meaningful relationship between Kosciuszko and Jefferson that has been heretofore neglected by the latter's biographers. In the process, they illuminate the origins and arguments of the early anti-slavery organizations in America, provide a detailed account of the life of Agrippa Hull, and a masterly treatment of the seeming of Jefferson's personal struggle with the slavery issue. Focusing, as they do, on the issues of freedom and liberty, Nash and Hodges provide through they eyes of the three protagonists the varied perspectives so often missing from traditional political histories. Their book should make for excellent reading for scholars and classrooms alike." -- <i>James S. Pula, author of <i>Tadeusz Kosciuszko: The Purest Son of Liberty</i>, and Professor of History at Purdue University</i><br><br>"With the energy, adventure, and rich prose of a picaresque novel, <i>Friends of Liberty</i> explores a deep politics of race that shaped the early American nation.

Now, the darkness from beyond that border has begun to enfold Southmarch - or Shadowmarch - the Qua&#39;s ancient home. To stop the darkness falling, the Southmarch royal family must face their human enemies, supposed friends and the family curse.

There, the Qar hide behind the "Shadowline," a mysterious veil of perpetual mist, which drives mad any human who dares enter it. Bordering that mist and named for it is Shadowmarch, the northernmost human kingdom.</p><p> Shadowmarch has lately fallen on hard times. Its king has been captured by a rival kingdom, the regent has been mysteriously slain, and the new regents are callow fifteen-year-olds. Moody, crippled Prince Barrick is uninterested in their responsibilities and haunted by eerie dreams. His twin, Princess Briony, takes their new duties seriously, but is hot-tempered and headstrong. How can they defeat the greatest threats in Shadowmarch history? Their nobles plot to overthrow them--and the plotters may include their pregnant stepmother, seeking the throne for her own child. The expanding empire of Xis has sent its agents into Shadowmarch. And, for the first time since it appeared centuries ago, the Shadowline has starting moving. As the maddening mist spreads south over Shadowmarch, it does not quite hide the powerful, uncanny, and vengeful Qar army of invasion... <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p><b>Tad Williams&nbsp;</b>is a California-based fantasy superstar.&nbsp; His genre-creating (and genre-busting) books have sold tens of millions worldwide.&nbsp; His considerable output of epic fantasy and epic science fiction series, fantastical stories of all kinds, urban fantasy novels, comics, scripts, etc., have strongly influenced a generation of writers.&nbsp; Tad always has several secret projects on the go. 2016 will see the debut of a number of them; March 2017 brings&nbsp;<i>The Witchwood Crown</i>, the first volume in the long-awaited return to the world of the Memory, Sorrow &amp; Thorn novels.

Drawing on still-secret KGB archives, Costello (Ten Days to Destiny, 1991, etc.) and Tsarev (a former Soviet state-security officer) relate the tale of Alexander Orlov, one of the highest- ranking operatives ever to defect from the USSR. A Byelorussian Jew, Orlov caught the attention of Feliks Dzerzhinsky (founder of the Soviet secret police) for his guerrilla activities during and after WW I. Orlov proved a natural spy and, according to his 17- volume Kremlin file, played a leading role in the creation of the UK's Cambridge network (Kim Philby et al.) as well as the Berlin section of the ``Red Orchestra,'' a band of underground agents whose feats helped determine the course of WW II and, early on, its cold war aftermath. Having run afoul of Stalin, however, Orlov fled Spain (where he had been posted as Rezidentura) in 1938 to escape assassination. Finding a safe haven in the US, he made a splash during the early 1950's with a sensational book on Stalin's crimes. Though he subsequently slipped out of the limelight, Orlov was reckoned a splendid catch by the intelligence officials and lawmakers who constantly debriefed him. But as Costello and Tsarev make clear, the former spy was more refugee than apostate, never betraying, for example, any of the 60-odd moles of whom he had personal knowledge--knowledge that kept KGB hit men at bay. On the evidence of his dossier, moreover, Orlov was considered a hero of the Soviet Union well before his death in 1973. Nor was he held in less esteem by America's establishment, which eulogized him in the Congressional Record.

The lives of workers, managers, inventors, owners, and entrepreneurs are brilliantly illuminated by Anthony F. C.

Wallace examines the new relationships between employer and employee as work and workers moved out of the fields into the closed-in world of the spinning mule, the power loom, and the mill office. He brings to light the impassioned battle for the soul of the mill worker, a struggle between the exponents of the Enlightenment and Utopian Socialism, on the one hand, and, on the other, the ultimately triumphant champions of evangelical Christianity.</p><p>Anthony F.

"The lessons they teach are clear indeed," writes Berry, a marketing professor and director of the Center for Retailing Studies at Texas A &amp; M University. "Although the companies differ on the outside--the nature, size and structure of their businesses--to a remarkable degree they are the same on the inside, sharing the drivers of their ongoing success." The "nine drivers" that Berry uncovers are the following: Leading with Values, Strategic Focus, Executional Excellence, Control of Destiny, Trust-Based Relationships, Investment in Employee Success, Acting Small, Brand Cultivation, and Generosity. Berry, whose previous books include <i>On Great Service: A Framework for Action</i> and <i>Delivering Quality Service</i>, writes that the basis of a successful service organization is value-driven leadership and "building a <i>humane</i> community that <i>humanely</i> serves customers and the broader community in which they live." <i>Discovering the Soul of Service</i> is inspiring--and potentially profitable--reading for anyone in business today. <i>--Dan Ring</i>In a world where customers regard flawless products as a given, service is the key differentiator between competitors in any field.

It's the story of how Beattie, the most popular writer on the controversial new-psychotherapy phenomenon, codependency, got through the experience of her 12-year-old son's fatal skiing accident and its aftermath. Like so many others who've endured the loss of a loved one, she drifted and obsessed, became a trial for her friends to be with and a prey for hucksters taking advantage of her distraction. She got through it all by reconnecting with her capacity to love--much needed because her daughter, drinking and drugging, was in the throes of midteen meltdown.

But music could not be explained without addressing language, and could not be accounted for without understanding the evolution of the human body and mind. Thus Mithen arrived at the wildly ambitious project that unfolds in this book: an exploration of music as a fundamental aspect of the human condition, encoded into the human genome during the evolutionary history of our species. </p><p> Music is the language of emotion, common wisdom tells us. In <i>The Singing Neanderthals</i>, Mithen introduces us to the science that might support such popular notions. With equal parts scientific rigor and charm, he marshals current evidence about social organization, tool and weapon technologies, hunting and scavenging strategies, habits and brain capacity of all our hominid ancestors, from <i>australopithecines</i> to <i>Homo erectus</i>, <i>Homo heidelbergensis</i> and Neanderthals to <i>Homo sapiens</i>--and comes up with a scenario for a shared musical and linguistic heritage. Along the way he weaves a tapestry of cognitive and expressive worlds--alive with vocalized sound, communal mimicry, sexual display, and rhythmic movement--of various species. </p><p> The result is a fascinating work--and a succinct riposte to those, like Steven Pinker, who have dismissed music as a functionless evolutionary byproduct. </p></p><p>Steven Mithen is Professor of Early Prehistory and Pro Vice Chancellor at theUniversity of Reading.Why should music be so important to us? Steven Mithen begins his task with a detailed analysis of music and musical ability, drawing on musicology, psychology and neurobiology to build a comprehensive and erudite picture of music's capacity to move us...This is a long-overdue book, which approaches human evolution from an intriguing as well as entertaining angle.<br> --R. I. M. Dunbar (<i>Times Literary Supplement</i> 2005-07-28)<br><br>Mithen draws on archaeological record and current research on neurology and genetics to explain how and why humans think, talk and make music the way they do. If it sounds impenetrably academic, it isn't: Mithen acts as a friendly guide to the troves of data on the evolution of man (and myriad sub-mysteries of the mind, music, speech and cognition), translating specialist material into an engrossing narrative casual readers will appreciate...Mithen's expertise in the science and history of his subject is combined with a passion for music that makes this book enjoyable and fascinating. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2006-02-27)<br><br>Mithen has many fascinating suggestions about how the circumstances of early hominid life on the African savanna may have provoked changes in anatomy and improved the range and precision of communication...By bringing music to the fore, Mithen remedies earlier neglect and offers his readers the most perspicacious portrait of the role of communication among our remote predecessors that I have ever encountered. That is a great accomplishment...Mithen's book, in short, seems destined to become a landmark in the way experts and amateurs alike seek to understand the character and evolutionary importance of hominid and early human communication...[<i>The Singing Neanderthals</i>] offers a learned, imaginative overview of the most important and most elusive dimension of the real but unrecorded past: i.e., how communication among our predecessors changed their lives, sustained their communities, and promoted their survival. No one has previously undertaken that task so well.<br> --William H. McNeill (<i>New York Review of Books</i> 2006-04-27)<br><br>With a fascinating blend of neurology, anatomy, archaeology, developmental psychology and musicology, Mithen seeks the source of our propensity for making music, a universal human feature that has been strangely neglected compared with the origin of language.<br> --Blake Edgar (<i>Scientific American</i>)<br><br>Among the most dicey academic inquiries are the ones that deal with the origin of human consciousness. Faced with difficulties of such daunting scope, Steven Mithen remains undaunted. In his 1996 book, <i>The Prehistory of the Mind</i>, he argued that both the origins of thought and the origins of human language are natural outcomes of evolution. But according to the first chapter of Mithen's latest work, <i>The Singing Neanderthals</i>, that story was incomplete. What it neglected was the central role of music in the psychosocial makeup of our species...'Without music,' Mithen writes, 'the prehistoric past is just too quiet to be believed'...Thus, Mithen speculates, humanity might have developed much as the individual does: music first, then language. From an evolutionary standpoint, music would not only help ensure the well-being of the individual, but also the cohesiveness of the group. Calling on primate studies, Mithen likens group music-making to grooming, an activity that evokes feelings of contentment and belonging...Taken as a look at the natural history of music, Mithen's book is thoughtful and certainly entertaining.<br> --Laurence A.

From the highly erotic world of nature around her to the hard tactile labor of farm life, from the country doctor who befriends her to the boy who loved but was forced to leave her, Miss Jane Chisolm and her world are anything but barren.</p><p>The potency and implacable cruelty of nature, as well as its beauty, is a trademark of Watson&#x2019;s fiction. In <em>Miss Jane</em>, the author brings to life a hard, unromantic past that is tinged with the sadness of unattainable loves, yet shot through with a transcendent beauty. Jane Chisolm&#x2019;s irrepressible vitality and generous spirit give her the strength to live her life as she pleases in spite of the limitations that others, and her own body, would place on her.

A writer of profound emotional depths, Watson does not lie to his reader, so neither does his Jane. She never stops longing for a wholeness she may never know, but she is determined that her citizenship in the world, however onerous, be dragged into the light and there be lived without apology or perfection or pity.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Amy Grace Loyd, <em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Watson infuses the story with curiosity, uncertainty, and, not unlike Jeffrey Eugenides&#x2019;s <em>Middlesex</em>, a certain wildness...The book plays on the tongue like an oyster&#x2015;first salty, then cold&#x2015;before slipping away to be consumed and digested.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Aditi Sriram, <em>Washington Post</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;One of the most spot-on, most poetic renderings of Southern vernacular this side of Charles Portis.

First he had died, he said, and then&#x2013;snap!&#x2013;the desert. He told the story to everyone who would listen, bobbing his head to follow the sound of their footsteps. Showers of red grit fell from his beard. He said that the desert was bare and lonesome and that it had hissed at him like a snake. He had walked for days and days, until the dunes broke apart beneath his feet, surging up around him to lash at his face. Then everything went still and began to beat like a heart. The sound was as clear as any he had ever heard. It was only at that moment, he said, with a million arrow points of sand striking his skin, that he truly realized he was dead.<br><br>Jim Singer, who managed the sandwich shop in the monument district, said that he had felt a prickling sensation in his fingers and then stopped breathing. "It was my heart," he insisted, thumping firmly on his chest. "Took me in my own bed." He had closed his eyes, and when he opened them again, he was on a train, the kind that trolleys small children around in circles at amusement parks. The rails were leading him through a thick forest of gold-brown trees, but the trees were actually giraffes, and their long necks were reaching like branches into the sky. A wind rose up and peeled the spots from their backs. The spots floated down around him, swirling and dipping in the wake of the train. It took him a long time to understand that the throbbing noise he heard was not the rattling of the wheels along the tracks.<br><br>The girl who liked to stand beneath the poplar tree in the park said that she had died into an ocean the color of dried cherries. For a while the water had carried her weight, she said, and she had lain on her back turning in meaningless circles, singing the choruses of the pop songs she remembered. But then there was a drum of thunder, and the clouds split open, and the ball bearings began to pelt down around her&#x2013;tens of thousands of them. She had swallowed as many as she could, she said, stroking the cracked trunk of the poplar tree. She didn't know why. She filled like a canvas sack and sank slowly through the layers of the ocean. Shoals of fish brushed past her, their blue and yellow scales the single brightest thing in the water. And all around her she heard that sound, the one that everybody heard, the regular pulsing of a giant heart.<br><br>The stories people told about the crossing were as varied and elaborate as their ten billion lives, so much more particular than those other stories, the ones they told about their deaths. After all, there were only so many ways a person could die: either your heart took you, or your head took you, or it was one of the new diseases. But no one followed the same path over the crossing. Lev Paley said that he had watched his atoms break apart like marbles, roll across the universe, then gather themselves together again out of nothing at all. Hanbing Li said that he woke inside the body of an aphid and lived an entire life in the flesh of a single peach. Graciella Cavazos would say only that she began to snow&#x2013;four words&#x2013;and smile bashfully whenever anyone pressed her for details.<br><br>No two reports were ever the same. And yet always there was the drumlike thumping noise.<br><br>Some people insisted that it never went away, that if you concentrated and did not turn your ear from the sound, you could hear it faintly behind everything in the city&#x2013;the brakes and the horns, the bells on the doors of restaurants, the clicking and slapping of different kinds of shoes on the pavement. Groups of people came together in parks or on rooftops just to listen for it, sitting quietly with their backs turned to one another. <i>Ba-dum. Ba-dum. Ba-dum</i>. It was like trying to keep a bird in sight as it lifted, blurred, and faded to a dot in the sky.<br><br>Luka Sims had found an old mimeograph machine his very first week in the city and decided to use it to produce a newspaper. He stood outside the River Road Coffee Shop every morning, handing out the circulars he had printed. One particular issue of the <i>L. Sims News &amp; Speculation Sheet</i>&#x2013;or the <i>Sims Sheet</i>, as people called it&#x2013;addressed the matter of this sound. Fewer than twenty percent of the people Luka interviewed claimed that they could still hear it after the crossing, but almost everyone agreed that it resembled nothing so much as&#x2013;could be nothing other than&#x2013;the pounding of a heart. The question, then, was, Where did it come from? It could not be their own hearts, for their hearts no longer beat. The old man Mahmoud Qassim believed that it was not the actual sound of his heart, but the remembered sound, which, because he had both heard and failed to notice it for so long, still resounded in his ears. The woman who sold bracelets by the river thought that it was the heartbeat at the center of the world, that bright, boiling place she had fallen through on her way to the city. "As for this reporter," the article concluded, "I hold with the majority. I have always suspected that the thumping sound we hear is the pulse of those who are still alive. The living carry us inside them like pearls. We survive only so long as they remember us." It was an imperfect metaphor&#x2013;Luka knew that&#x2013;since the pearl lasts much longer than the oyster. But rule one in the newspaper business was that you had to meet your deadlines. He had long since given up the quest for perfection.<br><br>There were more people in the city every day, and yet the city never failed to accommodate them. You might be walking down a street you had known for years, and all of a sudden you would come upon another building, another whole block. Carson McCaughrean, who drove one of the sleek black taxis that roamed the streets, had to redraw his maps once a week. Twenty, thirty, fifty times a day, he would pick up a fare who had only recently arrived in the city and have to deliver him somewhere he&#x2013;Carson&#x2013;had never heard of. They came from Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Americas. They came from churning metropolises and from small islands in the middle of the ocean. That was what the living did: they died. There was an ancient street musician who began playing in the red brick district as soon as he reached the city, making slow, sad breaths with his accordion. There was a jeweler, a young man, who set up shop at the corner of Maple and Christopher Streets and sold diamonds that he mounted on silver pendants. Jessica Auffert had operated her own jewelry shop on the same corner for more than thirty years, but she did not seem to resent the man, and in fact brought him a mug of fresh black coffee every morning, exchanging gossip as she drank with him in his front room. What surprised her was how young he was&#x2013;how young so many of the dead were these days. Great numbers of them were no more than children, who clattered around on skateboards or went racing past her window on their way to the playground. One, a boy with a strawberry discoloration on his cheek, liked to pretend that the rocking horses he tossed himself around on were real horses, the horses he had brushed and fed on his farm before they were killed in the bombing. Another liked to swoop down the slide over and over again, hammering his feet into the gravel as he thought about his parents and his two older brothers, who were still alive. He had watched them lift free of the same illness that had slowly sucked him under. He did not like to talk about it.<br><br>This was during a war, though it was difficult for any of them to remember which one.<br><br>* * *<br><br>Occasionally one of the dead, someone who had just completed the crossing, would mistake the city for heaven. It was a misunderstanding that never persisted for long. What kind of heaven had the blasting sound of garbage trucks in the morning, and chewing gum on the pavement, and the smell of fish rotting by the river? What kind of hell, for that matter, had bakeries and dogwood trees and perfect blue days that made the hairs on the back of your neck rise on end? No, the city was not heaven, and it was not hell, and it certainly was not the world. It stood to reason, then, that it had to be something else. More and more people came to adopt the theory that it was an extension of life itself&#x2013;a sort of outer room&#x2013;and that they would remain there only so long as they endured in living memory. When the last person who had actually known them died, they would pass over into whatever came next. It was true that most of the city's occupants went away after sixty or seventy years, and while this did not prove the theory, it certainly served to nourish it. There were stories of men and women who had been in the city much longer, for centuries and more, but there were always such stories, in every time and place, and who knew whether to believe them?<br><br>Every neighborhood had its gathering spot, a place where people could come together to trade news of the other world. There was the colonnade in the monument district, and the One and Only Tavern in the warehouse district, and right next to the greenhouse, in the center of the conservatory district, was Andrei Kalatozov's Russian Tea Room. Kalatozov poured the tea he brewed from a brass samovar into small porcelain cups that he served on polished wooden platters. His wife and daughter had died a few weeks before he did, in an accident involving a land mine they had rooted up out of the family garden. He was watching through the kitchen window when it happened. His wife's spade struck a jagged hunk of metal, so cankered with rust from its century underground that he did not realize what it was until it exploded. Two weeks later, when he put the razor to his throat, it was with the hope that he would be reunited with his family in heaven. And, sure enough, there they were&#x2013;his wife and daughter&#x2013;smiling and taking coats at the door of the tea room. Kalatozov watched them as he sliced a le...</p><h2>Newport Houses</h2><p><br>The architectural heritage of Newport, Rhode Island encompasses the rich and lively history of the people who have lived there.

To describe them, the authors of this lavish volume have chosen a completely opposite approach from that of Antoinette F. Downing and Vincent J. Scully, Jr., in their standard The Architectural Heritage of Newport, Rhode Island 1640-1915. That book, published over 30 years ago, is a highly scholarly tome stressing colonial and early 19th-century architecture. Its small black-and-white photographs record the exteriors of demolished and then-extant structures. In marked contrast, this glorious "picture book," with its 175 photographs of interior and exterior views, focuses on currently standing buildings from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It is obviously designed for browsing; the Contents page is the only aid for locating information. In the chatty text, discussion of architecture takes a back seat to anecdotes about colorful occupants. Artistic and visually inspiring? Yes, but in no way as informative as Downing and Scully's work.<br><i>- Kathleen Eagen Johnson, Historic Hudson Valley, Tarrytown, N.Y.</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>From The Heart Of The Crow Country: The Crow Indians&#39; Own Stories (Library of the American Indian)</h2><p>A highly respected elder of the Crow tribe draws on stories he has collected throughout his lifetime to offer a unique glimpse of American Indian culture as Indians themselves know it.

Laid out so that the text runs vertically instead of horizontally, each spread represents a different layer of an old-fashioned jewelry box. The inside cover simulates the opening of the box, with a summons to lift a flap and watch a "beautiful ballerina" emerge. Readers can pass their hands through a charm bracelet that folds out from the page; try on two rows' worth of rings; tell time by lifting the lids of two pocket watches; and see themselves reflected when they open a gold locket "with a picture of you inside!" Milstein encourages interaction in other ways too: she prompts readers to count the pearls on a strand or pick a favorite trinket. The interior of the jewel box is depicted in dingy beige with discreet white rosettes, while the dull brown borders seem intended to suggest a wood exterior. Although often imaginative, the book doesn't quite satisfy. One wishes for a plush red lining or detachable art--something to make the package sparkle.

This Penguin Modern Classics edition contains an introduction by David Lodge. Jim Dixon has accidentally fallen into a job at one of Britain&#39;s new red brick universities. A moderately successful future in the History Department beckons - as long as Jim can stave off the unwelcome advances of fellow lecturer Margaret, survive a madrigal-singing weekend at Professor Welch&#39;s, deliver a lecture on &#39;Merrie England&#39; and resist Christine, the hopelessly desirable girlfriend of Welch&#39;s awful son Bertrand. Inspired by Amis&#39;s friend, the poet Philip Larkin, Jim Dixon is a timeless comic character, adrift in a hopelessly gauche and pretentious world. Kingsley Amis (1922-1995), born in London, wrote poetry, criticism, and short stories, but is best remembered as the novelist whose works offered a comic deconstruction of post-war Britain. Amis explored his disillusionment with British society in novels such as Lucky Jim (1954) and That Uncertain Feeling (1955); his other works include The Green Man (1970) Stanley and the Women (1984), and The Old Devils (1986) which won the Booker Prize. If you enjoyed Lucky Jim, you might like Amis&#39;s The King&#39;s English, also available in Penguin Modern Classics. &#39;A flawless comic novel ... I loved it then, as I do now. It has always made me laugh out loud&#39; Helen Dunmore, The Times &#39;A brilliantly and preposterously funny book&#39; Guardian</p><p>Although Kingsley Amis's acid satire of postwar British academic life has lost some of its bite in the four decades since it was published, it's still a rewarding read. And there's no denying how big an impact it had back then--<i>Lucky Jim</i> could be considered the first shot in the Oxbridge salvo that brought us <i>Beyond the Fringe</i>, <i>That Was the Week That Was</i>, and so much more. <p> In <i>Lucky Jim</i>, Amis introduces us to Jim Dixon, a junior lecturer at a British college who spends his days fending off the legions of malevolent twits that populate the school. His job is in constant danger, often for good reason. <i>Lucky Jim</i> hits the heights whenever Dixon tries to keep a preposterous situation from spinning out of control, which is every three pages or so. The final example of this--a lecture spewed by a hideously pickled Dixon--is a chapter's worth of comic nirvana. The book is not politically correct (Amis wasn't either), but take it for what it is, and you won't be disappointed.</p>Kingsley Amis&#39; (1922-1995) works take a humorous yet highly critical look at British society, especially of the period following the end of World War II.

Ours begins on a disgruntled day in autumn, in the unsuspecting year of 1938.</p> <p>It could have begun a generation earlier, of course&#x2014;in 1914, as the British Expeditionary Force whistled its way off to war with the Kaiser. Or 1918, when the few that were left dragged themselves back. There again, we could have started a century earlier when the hooves of the Emperor Napoleon's cavalry turned the continent of Europe into a muddy dying place that stretched from the tumbling rivers and mountains of Spain to the gates of imperial Moscow. Extend the imagination just a little and we could go back&#x2014;why, a thousand years, to that day on a hill overlooking the coast of Sussex when King Harold raised his eyes to view his enemy in full retreat, and got nothing but an arrow for his efforts&#x2014;or another thousand years still, to the time of the great Julius and his invasion fleet as they landed a little further along the shore. We could go back to almost any day, in fact, and still it would be the same. Johnny Foreigner was a pain.</p> <p>But this story starts on the Bayswater Road, and not with a King or an invading Emperor but an undersized figure named McFadden. He is a gentlemen's barber, and a good one. One of the best, in fact. A man with a sharp eye for detail and a soft hand, a punctilious sort of fellow both by his nature and by his trade. Yet McFadden is late, which is unusual for him. And he shouldn't be late, not today, for this is the day he has agreed to be married.</p> <p>He has dressed as best he can in the circumstances, but it doesn't quite work. The heavy wool jacket is meant for someone at least ten pounds lighter and the button at his belly keeps coming undone. The rose in his buttonhole also refuses to cooperate. It has slipped away from its pin and is threatening to jump. McFadden mutters a dark spell under his breath and makes running repairs, hastening on his way, which isn't easy with his pronounced limp. We haven't mentioned his limp, but he has something badly wrong with his hips, which are out of line, and when he hurries he has to swivel his entire body in order to propel his right leg forward. So McFadden never likes to hurry. This isn't working out as he had hoped.</p> <p>He had planned to make the journey by underground train from his home near the Piggeries in North Kensington to the register office at Caxton Hall, but when he turned up at the station he found nothing but an untidy notice pasted on the gates&#x2014;"closed for urgent structural repairs." A minor deception, so far as official pronouncements went. The whole of London knows the truth. The station roofs are being reinforced so they can be used as bomb shelters.</p> <p>Ah, but there isn't going to be any bombing.</p> <p>They have the Prime Minister's word on that. He has flown back from Munich just the day before to announce that he has brought with him "peace with honor, peace for our time." Mac doesn't believe him, of course. Another cholemi, goddamn lie. Ever since the mohel had turned him over on the kitchen table and assured him that it wouldn't hurt, moments before cutting the end off his prick, he has known that the System always lies. (Not that he can remember anything about his circumcision, of course, but his elder brothers Yulek and Vovek never spared him the more gruesome details. He had screamed for hours afterwards.) Mac knows about lies. Lies have followed him like a shadow wherever he has gone and were usually there to greet him when he arrived&#x2014;in Poland, in Germany, and particularly all those years in Russia. Now he is in England, and the only difference in Mac's mind between Mr. Neville Chamberlain and the psychopath Stalin is that the Englishman went to a proper school and has learned not to scratch his balls in public&#x2014;although, come to think of it, Mac has never seen photographs of Stalin holding his own umbrella, there is that difference, too.</p> <p>His leg is hurting like hell. It's always giving him gyp&#x2014;he can't remember a time when the bloody thing wasn't on fire&#x2014;and the damper it gets the more it burns, deep inside, right to the marrow of the bone. So Mac decides to take a shortcut across the park. Not one of his better decisions. The flat expanse of Hyde Park is usually serene and calm, but something has happened. Instead of green acres, Mac is greeted by a bubbling chaos of mud. Like Judgment Day. On all sides the earth has been torn open where workmen with pickaxes and mechanical shovels have hacked a chaotic maze of holes into the thick London clay. Trenches everywhere. "Air Raids&#x2014;Public&#x2014;For The Use Of"&#x2014;hah! These bloody holes can't offer protection from the rain let alone from fat Goering's bombs. They aren't finished and already they've begun to fill with water, sullen and brown. Typical English idiocy. Treating war like a game of cricket. Something to be called off if it rains. Tzibeleh! They grow like onions, these English, with their heads stuck firmly in the earth.</p> <p>The spoil from the newly dug graves is beginning to cling to Mac's shoes and find its way onto the legs of his trousers, even though the trousers, like the jacket, are conspicuously short. That's why they had been cheap, from the pawnbrokers on the Portobello. It's his only suit. And the rose in its lapel is wobbling once more.</p> <p>McFadden isn't his real name, of course. Jewish boys born in Poland just before the turn of the century had names like Kleinman and Dubner and Goldberg. He'd been born in the small market town of Wadowice at the foot of the Carpathian mountains, in an airless upstairs room next to the women's ritual bathhouse and on a hot summer's day that had hung heavy with the dust from the harvest. He was one of six children and had been nothing more obvious than a schoolboy who spent his spare evenings as a part-time tailor's assistant, someone who was of no interest to anyone other than his parents, but that was before they had decided that they needed a new type of System in Europe and tore the old one apart. Mac had belonged to a small class of friends, eighteen in total, and every one of them had been swept up in the madness, conscripted, forced to fight for the Kaiser as part of Auffenberg's Fourth Army. But the Fourth Army had lasted only weeks and Mac's unit had been cut to pieces in front of the river town of Jaroslaw. Literally, cut to pieces. It was amazing how high a boy's screams could rise more than a year after his voice had broken. But still Mac hadn't escaped the System, for those few of his class who remained alive had been captured and questioned, then stood against a crumbling farmyard wall beside a filthy chicken coop and told they had a choice. The System was giving them a choice! Either they could fight for the Tsar or, if they preferred, they could be shot. Not much of a choice when you're still a few months short of your seventeenth birthday. So for the remainder of that awful year they had fought for the Russians against their old German comrades until the Revolution had come to rescue them from the madness and at last Mac had been able to throw away his rifle. But by then only he and Moniek, the doctor's son, were left. Still, they were alive, they felt special and they rejoiced. It was the last time Mac could remember being happy.</p></p><h2>Red Shift</h2><p><p>A disturbing exploration of the inevitability of life.</p><p>Under Orion&#x2019;s stars, bluesilver visions torment Tom, Macey and Thomas as they struggle with age-old forces.

Meetings with Mary ranges from Elijah's vision of Mary eight hundred years before her birth to the world-famous children of Medjugorje in Bosnia, whose encounters with her began in 1981 and continue daily.<br>Often accompanied by miracles, blessings, ecstasies, and healings, Mary and her devotees offer the world a powerful invitation to prayer, forgiveness, hope, and love. Here, among others, are the celebrated apparitions of the Blessed Mother to the apostles in Jerusalem, St. Ignatius Loyola, and St. Teresa of Avila; those at Lourdes, Guadalupe, and Fatima; and the recent apocalyptic visions in Rwanda.

Skin popping or stealing pain pills from his mom help him relax. But Lil J's focus is wandering because money is short, and his man Rico knows a way to make some quick cash. It's supposed to be an easy deal, but it isn't so simple when the buyer is an undercover cop.</p><p>With a gunshot wound to the arm, Rico in jail, and a police officer clinging to life, Lil J is starting to get dope sick. He'd do anything to change the last twenty-four hours, and when he stumbles into an abandoned crack house, it actually might be possible. . . .</p><p>Walter Dean Myers weaves elements of magical realism into a harrowing story about drug use, violence, alternate perceptions of reality, and second chances.</p></p><p><p>Walter Dean Myers was the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Monster</em>, the winner of the first Michael L.

Edwards Award for lifetime achievement in writing for young adults, a three-time National Book Award Finalist, as well as the first-ever recipient of the Coretta Scott King-Virginia Hamilton Award for Lifetime Achievement.</p>Starred Review. Using both harsh realism and a dose of the fantastic, Myers (<i>Game</i>) introduces an inner-city teen in the jaws of a crisis: 17-year-old Lil J is holed up in an abandoned building, believed to have shot an undercover cop in a drug bust, while police officers assemble in the street below. As he searches for a way out, Lil J is stopped by Kelly, an eerily calm vagrant who invites him to cop a squat and check yourself out on the tube. Kelly's TV not only plays scenes from Lil J's life but projects what will happen if he sticks with his current plan: suicide. Shocked, Lil J considers Kelly's question, If you could take back one thing you did... what would it be? Aided by Kelly's TV, Lil J revisits pivotal moments and wrestles with his fate. As expected, Myers uses street-style lingo to cover Lil J's sorry history of drug use, jail time, irresponsible fatherhood and his own childhood grief. A didn't-see-that-coming ending wraps up the story on a note of well-earned hope and will leave readers with plenty to think about.

START HERE! Why your prospects buy is exponentially more important than How you sell. Companies spend thousands of hours and millions of dollars annually teaching their people how to sell, instead of investing in answering the only question that ever matters to the bottom line: Why they buy? Cheri Tree discovered that answer when she decided to apply psychology to buyology. Now she s ready to share with readers the four basic personality types: B.A.N.K.TM Blueprint, Action, Nurturing, Knowledge. Most salespeople attempt to sell based on their own personality type precisely why 66 percent of customers are turned off by sales presentations. However, when you decipher your prospects B.A.N.K. codes, you will be far more likely to get the Yes! and close the sale. Why They Buy will teach you how to: Crack others personality codes in less than 90 seconds Connect quickly and on a deeper level with your prospects Communicate clearly and effectively in any situation Deliver memorable presentations that emphasize your core message Accelerate customer acquisition and increase retention Develop a highly trained sales force with a competitive advantage Expand your business and lead your teams to record success Maximize your influence and capitalize on your charisma Are you ready to increase your sales up to 300 percent? If so, this book will unlock the secrets, the science, and the system to supercharge your sales and build solid relationships, personally and professionally. When you crack the personality code, you will achieve record sales and real wealth that you can take to the BANK!</p><p>CHERI TREE is a best-selling author, professional keynote speaker, executive business coach, world-renowned sales trainer, and entrepreneur. She is the Founder and CEO of BANKCODE, with clients in more than 40 countries worldwide. Cheri has spoken to hundreds of thousands of entrepreneurs and sales professionals globally.

Cheri has also lectured at Harvard University and UC Berkeley, and she is considered the number one personality sales trainer in the world. She lives in Laguna Beach, California.New Book Reveals World s Greatest Sales Secret In Why They Buy: Cracking the Personality Code to Achieve Record Sales and Real Wealth, entrepreneur Cheri Tree reveals her game-changing system that will help any salesperson connect with his or her prospects in a way that will seal the deal and create win-win situations for everyone. Being in sales is one of the toughest jobs out there, but the truth is that we are all in sales. If we re not trying to sell a product to our customers, we re trying to sell our kids on eating their vegetables or our employer on giving us a raise. Every day, we are faced with situations where we need to sell (promote our agenda or viewpoint), and we can achieve more success in all these sales situations when we learn the personality code of the person we re trying to sell to. How do we do that? By using Cheri Tree s B.A.N.K. system that she outlines in simple and practical detail in this book. Rest assured, B.A.N.K. is not a system to manipulate people into buying something they don t want. It s a system to help you learn how to connect with people using the language they want to hear. As Cheri points out in the book, 66 percent of customers are turned off by presentations given by salespeople. That s because the salesperson is not speaking in a language the customer wants to hear or really understands. As Cheri reveals, people have different personalities, so if you want to sell to someone, you have to understand that person s personality type. B.A.N.K. is an acronym for the four personality types, and since there s four of them, if you don t know the person s personality type, you only have a 1 in 4 chance of making the right sales pitch. However, as research indicates, 82 percent of people want to buy from their matching personality type. That means that if the salesperson doesn t match their personality type, the salesperson will likely lose the sale. B.A.N.K. helps the salesperson identity the customer s personality type in less than ninety seconds so he or she can morph the customer s type and then have an excellent chance of closing the sale! To explain all four of the personality types here would be to give away too much information better you read about them in the book. In fact, you can take a quiz to determine your own personality type. I will just say that Cheri walks readers step-by-step through the mindset behind why B.A.N.K. works better than any other sales program. Then she goes into detail in her description of each of the four personality types so you will understand the types likes, dislikes, and idiosyncrasies and can tailor your sales presentation and all communications accordingly. Once you do this, your prospects will be more receptive to your message and you ll improve your sales and relationships. Yes, B.A.N.K. really works! In fact, Cheri is living proof of it. She is very honest throughout the book about the struggles she went through in sales before she discovered this system. She states: I started off at the bottom...the very bottom! My dream of being a successful entrepreneur got crushed when I realized that I sucked at sales. I was so terrible that during my entire first year in sales as a commission-only financial advisor, I only earned $700! I was the worst salesperson on the team! Cheri goes on to describe how she spent years trying to figure out what she was doing wrong until she discovered the B.A.N.K. system. Then, she tells us, Using the B.A.N.K. code, I took my income in a single year from $72,000 to over $500,000 a 695 percent increase. Within three years, my annual income surpassed one million dollars and the rest, they say, is history. --Tyler R. Tichelaar, Ph.D. and award-winning author of Narrow Lives and Arthur s Legacy<br><br>But there s a lot more to B.A.N.K. than just sales and making money. Not that money isn t important money, as Cheri points out, does bring happiness because it makes life easier for people; it allows them to fulfill their dreams, have security, and take care of their loved ones. But more importantly, B.A.N.K. can help us improve our relationships with everyone from our loved ones to our customers and strangers. Cheri states: You want to know what Cheri Tree is really about? I m about changing lives. I don t care at all about the money, but I know that helping you make more money can change your life. Money can help you achieve your real dreams. Sure, people have told me, Money doesn t buy you happiness. But when they say that, I usually reply, Well, I recommend you try making at least a million dollars in one year and then reevaluate that saying! That s another silly myth, right? Money definitely can buy you a lot of happiness, but money isn t everything. Most of Why They Buy is dedicated to the power of B.A.N.K. to help people in sales, but Cheri also offers examples of how learning each other s B.A.N.K. codes has helped family members learn to communicate better; it s even helped people connect with people who are suicidal to save their lives. It could actually bring world peace as world leaders learn how to communicate with each other using this system. That world peace dream isn t even all that far-fetched considering that Cheri Tree has already introduced B.A.N.K. to thousands of people and it s made its way into more than forty countries. With that kind of success record and growing I can guarantee it s a system worth looking into. I rarely get as excited about reading a book as I did while reading Why They Buy. It s made me better understand myself I m a K with B as my second personality code. It s made me also understand better some of my loved ones whom I have difficulty communicating with. It s a practical, easy-to-use system that can definitely make a difference in your sales and your life. Try it out. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain. --Tyler R.

Tremayne lives in London, England.A second chapter in the seventh-century exploits of intelligent, highly educated Sister Fidelma of the Celtic Church in Ireland, aided as before by Brother Eadulf of Canterbury (Absolution by Murder, 1996). The two have traveled to Rome, where Fidelma is to deliver messages to His Holiness and where Eadulf will serve as scribe to archbishop-designate Wighard of Canterbury, the guest of Bishop Gelasius at Lateran Palace. Among the many pilgrims in the city to witness Wighard's ordination are Abbott Puttoc of Saxony, an ambitious libertine, and haughty Abbess Wulfrun and her companion-servant Sister Eafa of Kent. Before the ceremony can take place, though, Wighard is found strangled in his quarters, and Irish monk Ronan Ragallach is accused of the killing but escapes his captors. Not completely convinced of Ronan's guilt, and aware of Fidelma and Eadulf's previous successes, Bishop Gelasius asks their help and assigns soldier Licinius to ease their way. As Fidelma goes about the tedious questioning of everyone in the vicinity at the crucial time, the body count begins to mount and various intricate plots are uncovered. In the end, though, Fidelma finds the answer to their quest rooted in the heinous crimes of the not-so-distant past. The author's passion for the period results in an unrelenting stream of information--on Church theology, hierarchy, politics, rituals and residences, to say nothing of chapels and catacombs. The diffuse plotting, rarely compelling, suffocates under the onslaught. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

With 25 years of clinical experience she brings sensibility and real help to those who struggle. And her academic appointment at Eastern Virginia Medical School keeps her abreast of current research. A best-selling author, national news consultant, and blogger, she hosts her own website.From her perspective as a Christian therapist with more than 20 years of experience in private practice, Mintle (Divorce-Proofing Your Marriage, etc.) examines the difficulties inherent in the mother-daughter relationship as conventionally defined within U.S. culture. Addressed to women of all ages who want to forge a more intimate connection with their female parent, the author provides useful tools for coping with emotions and situations (beyond anger at obviously dysfunctional parenting) that prevent closeness, including a daughter's extreme need for approval or an inability to detach emotionally from her mother (leading either to very distant or excessively close connections). Mintle's practical advice is always alloyed by spiritual guidance. Anger-management techniques, for example, such as avoiding "nonessential triggers," talking problems over with friends and learning how to be assertive are presented along with appropriate verses drawn from the Bible. In addition to more active strategies, Mintle consistently recommends prayer and acceptance as the road to deepening a mother-daughter bond. She is convinced that the spiritual act of forgiveness, for even the most abusive or dysfunctional mothers, is a worthy and self-healing goal for daughters. The book will be of most help to those who share the author's deep religious commitment, which fans of her books on marriage, eating disorders and infertility will recognize. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

So my first and most important thanks go to all the Italians I have met over the years that I have spent in their country&#x2014;friends, neighbors and casual acquaintances&#x2014;because it is their descriptions of themselves and their explanations of their society, their recommendations and advice, their hints and silences that have done more than anything to give substance to this work.</p><p>I first lived and worked in Italy, briefly, at the age of eighteen and might never have returned except for the odd holiday had it not been for Paul Webster, who in 1994, while foreign editor of the Guardian, suggested that I rejoin the staff of the paper as its Southern Europe correspondent based in Rome. When I left Italy again, five years later, I had no plans to go back and probably would not have embarked on the writing of this book had Xan Smiley, the then Europe editor of the Economist, and Bill Emmott, its then editor, not arranged for me to become their correspondent in Italy. Warm thanks also to Alan Rusbridger, then as now the editor of the Guardian, who proposed that I be shared between the two publications and later agreed to my taking a period of unpaid leave to begin the writing of this book. John Micklethwait, the current editor of the Economist, also agreed to that, and later generously offered me a spell of paid leave so I could finish what I had started. John Peet, who has been the Europe editor of the Economist for most of the time I have worked for the magazine in Italy, has been unstintingly tolerant of my periodic retreats into book writing.</p><p>In each of my spells as a correspondent in Italy, I have benefited from the hospitality of national newspapers: first La Stampa, and more recently Corriere della Sera. It has given me access to a wealth of information about Italy and the Italians. I am very grateful to those who edited these two papers during the periods in which I worked on their premises, Ezio Mauro, Carlo Rossella, Stefano Folli, Paolo Mieli and Ferruccio de Bortoli, as well as to the Rome bureau chiefs and Rome supplement editors who were my immediate hosts: Marcello Sorgi, Ugo Magri, Antonio Macaluso, Marco Cianca, Andrea Garibaldi and Goffredo Buccini.</p><p>I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the reporters, specialist writers and regional correspondents of both papers. Italian journalists are unsparing in the help and advice they offer to their foreign colleagues and over the years I have acquired a huge debt of gratitude to those of La Stampa and Corriere della Sera for their insights and their readiness to share their knowledge with an outsider. Those who made direct contributions to the contents of this book include Massimo Franco, Lorenzo Fuccaro, Daria Gorodisky, Stefano Lepri, Dino Martirano and Ilaria Sacchettoni.</p><p>Thanks also to Eliza Apperly, Elizabeth Bailey, Lara Bryan, Simon Chambers, Bianca Cuomo, Giulia Di Michele, Bea Downing, Katharine Forster, Will Harman, Sophie Inge, Yerrie Kim of EF Education First, Tom Kington, Flavia Manini, Maria Luisa Manini, Hannah Murphy, Laura Nasso, Marie Obileye, Lorien Pilling of GBGC, Hannah Sims, Helen Tatlow, Katherine Travers, Ed Vulliamy, Tom Wachtel and Sean Wyer.</p><p>Paddy Agnew, Antonio Manca Graziadei and Isabella Clough Marinaro generously agreed to bring their specialist knowledge to bear on Chapters 14, 18 and 19, respectively. Francesca Andrews and Maria Bencivenni read through large sections of the book. Their observations and suggestions, which could have come only from a rich experience of the cultures and societies of both Italy and Britain, were invaluable. It goes without saying that the errors that remain are mine alone.</p><p>I could not have wanted a more involved, enthusiastic or charmingly persistent agent than Lucy Luck. And I have had the immense good fortune to have as my editor Simon Winder, who is not only a successful writer himself, but the author of books in a similar vein to my own. This one is all the better for his perceptive comments. Melanie Tortoroli at Penguin Group (USA) has been every bit as supportive (and patient).</p><p>This edition of the book also owes much to Christian Jungeblodt, an outstanding photographer and a good friend whose memorable glimpses of Italy and the Italians enhance the pages that follow. Many of the photographs are due to be published in a book, <i>Bella Italia Project,</i> supported by VG Bildkunst.</p><p>My wife, Lucinda Evans, read the entire manuscript with the keen eye of a former national newspaper subeditor. It has benefited greatly from her good judgment and feeling for words. But her main contribution has been a subtler one: she has been with me throughout my Italian adventure, and the insights and reflections she has shared with me along the way can be found in almost every chapter of this book.</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>The Beautiful Country</p><p><i>Il bel paese ch&#x2019;Appennin parte, e &#x2019;il mar circonda e l&#x2019;Alpe.</i></p><p>The beautiful country that the Apennines divide, and Alps and sea surround.</p><p>Petrarch</p><p>No one would choose to start a book at Porta Pia.</p><p>It is in one of the least attractive corners of central Rome, a place where architectural styles from different periods sit uncomfortably together like mutually suspicious in-laws. The biggest building in the vicinity is the British embassy, which dates from the 1970s. Its architect, Sir Basil Spence, was at great pains to ensure it blended in with its surroundings. Not everyone is convinced he succeeded. The embassy looks rather like a colossal concrete semiconductor, torn from the motherboard of a gargantuan computer.</p><p>The gate&#x2014;the <i>porta</i> itself&#x2014;takes its name from Pius IV, Michelangelo&#x2019;s last patron and the pope who brought the Council of Trent to a successful conclusion, thereby launching the Counter-Reformation. Michelangelo&#x2019;s friend and biographer, Giorgio Vasari, wrote that the artist offered Pius three designs, and that the pope chose the least expensive.* Nowadays, the gate he built forms one side of a bigger structure&#x2014;the side that faces toward the center of Rome. How much of Michelangelo&#x2019;s design has survived is open to question. A coin minted in 1561, when work began on the gate, and an engraving made three years after its completion depict two substantially different structures.</p><p>In the nineteenth century, another Pius&#x2014;Pope Pius IX&#x2014;had a courtyard put behind Michelangelo&#x2019;s gate (if it was any longer Michelangelo&#x2019;s gate) and added a new facade in the neoclassical style that looks away from the center of the city. Around the courtyard between the two facades, Pius IX erected some buildings for use as customs offices. Rome was still then the capital of the Papal States, a sizable territory that had been governed by the popes since the eighth century and whose latest ruler had indignantly refused to let it be incorporated into the new state of Italy.</p><p>On either side of Porta Pia stretch the Aurelian Walls. These were begun in the third century AD for the protection of ancient Rome. Lofty and sturdy, they continued to defend the city, with greater or lesser success, for the next fifteen centuries, and it was only by blasting a hole through them at a point about fifty meters west of Porta Pia that Italian troops were able to force their way into Rome, complete the unification of the peninsula and put an end to the temporal power of the popes. Many of the soldiers who poured through the breach on that September morning in 1870 belonged to an elite corps of Italy&#x2019;s new army known as the Bersaglieri (&#x201c;Marksmen&#x201d;). The customs offices inside Porta Pia were later turned into a museum for the Bersaglieri.</p><p>The area around the gate, then, is an eclectic muddle. But it brings together within a few hundred square meters tangible allusions to the bits of their history of which Italians are proudest: the Roman Empire, the Renaissance and the Risorgimento.* Some, though not all, would add to that list the papacy and the Counter-Reformation, which brought with it the splendors of Rome&#x2019;s Baroque churches.</p><p>What other people of comparable numbers can lay claim to such an extraordinary catalog of achievements? One nation&#x2014;even if it did not consider itself a nation until quite recently&#x2014;produced the only empire to have united Europe and the greatest cultural transformation in the history of the West, one that shaped our entire modern view of life. Along the way, the Italian peninsula emerged as the preeminent seat of Christendom.</p><p>No other nation can boast such a catalog of great painters and sculptors: Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael, of course. But also Donatello and Bernini, Piero della Francesca, Botticelli, Titian and Caravaggio. And there are others, like Mantegna, who are nowhere close to the top of the list but who would be hailed as national cultural icons in most other European countries. Then there are the architects&#x2014;Brunelleschi, Bramante, Palladio&#x2014;...</p></p><h2>Seven Pillars of Servant Leadership: Practicing the Wisdom of Leading by Serving</h2><p>Used. Very Good conditions. May have soft reading marks and name of the previous owner.</p><p></p><h2>The Decline and Fall of The Roman Empire</h2><p>Gripping, powerfully intelligent, and wonderfully entertaining, Gibbon's classic account of Rome ranks as one of the literary masterpieces of its age. Attacked for its enlightened views on politics, sexuality, and religion, the first volume was nonetheless found on every table and received widespread acclaim for its elegant prose. Famously skeptical about Christianity, unexpectedly sympathetic to the barbarian invaders and the Byzantine Empire, constantly aware of how political leaders often achieve the exact opposite of what they intend, Gibbon captured both the broad pattern of events and the significant revealing detail. This abridged edition compresses thirteen turbulent centuries into a single epic narrative, and features a foreword, introduction, and extended appreciation by Hugh Trevor-Roper, an esteemed professor of history at Oxford University.<br></p><p>EDWARD GIBBON was born in 1737. His brief career as an undergraduate at Magdalen College, Oxford, ended when he joined the Catholic Church, but he later re-joined the Protestant Church. After the death of his father, Gibbon settled in London and in 1774 was elected to Parliament where he sat for the next eight years. The first volume of his famous HISTORY was published in 1776; it was highly praised for its learning and style but incurred some censure for its treatment of the early Christians. The second and third volumes appeared in 1781 and the final three were published in 1788. HUGH TREVOR-ROPER was born in Northumberland in 1914 and educated at Charterhouse and Christ Church, Oxford. He was Regius Professor of Modern History and Fellow of Oriel College, Oxford 1957-80; Master of Peterhouse, Cambridge 1980-87. He became Lord Dacre of Glanton in 1979. Hugh Trevor-Roper died in 2003."[Gibbon] stood on the summit of the Renaissance achievement and looked back over the waste of history to ancient Rome, as from one mountain top to another."--Christopher Dawson <p>"From the Trade Paperback edition.</p></p><h2>A New History of French Literature</h2><p><p>This splendid introduction to French literature from 842 A.D. to the present decade is the most imaginative single-volume guide to the French literary tradition available in English.</p><p>Conceived for the general reader, this volume presents French literature not as a simple inventory of authors or titles, but rather as a historical and cultural field viewed from a wide array of contemporary critical perspectives. The book consists of 164 essays by American and European scholars, and covers the history of French literature from 842 to 1989.</p></p><p>Denis Hollier is Chairman of the Department of French at Yale University. He is the author of many books, including works on Sartre and Bataille.An impressive volume...It is not to be thought of as an exhaustive reference book, nor is it designed to be read right through as a single text. Its <i>mode d'emploi</i> is that of the browser. And as such it is indeed--as the blurbs repeat to us--a triumph. Plunge in, almost at random, and you will come up with pearls like Leo Bersani on Proust, DeJean on the salons or the editor on May 1968, discourse and power. I shall come back to it often. (Peter France <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>This remarkable collection of brief essays on topics ranging from the Strasbourg Oaths of 842 to a 1983 broadcast of 'Apostrophes,' France's celebrated television literary interview program, is far more than a survey of 12 centuries of writing in France. It is a fascinating, generally very readable and almost always unpredictable ramble through the thick and varied garden of culture tended for these many centuries by the French people. The volume's editor, Denis Hollier, a professor of French at Yale University, has managed the considerable feat of compiling hundreds of brief essays by 164 mostly American scholars of French literature and to impose on the whole extraordinary unity. The result is a Francophile's delight and a lucid, often entertaining display of erudition...You can drop your cup at random into this deep well of cultural history and almost always come up with something sweet and stimulating to drink. (Richard Bernstein <i>New York Times</i>)<br><br>An original and outstanding overview of French literature from 842 to the present...There is no history of French literature of this nature on the market today, in French or in English. Highly recommended. (Anthony Caprio <i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>Despite the eclectic nature of the various contributions...they nonetheless form a coherent ensemble thanks to the coordinating skills of a sophisticated editorial board and to Renee Morel's indispensable index...The fact is that this [book] has rendered its predecessors obsolete, making it one of a kind in its field today. (Ernest Sturm <i>French Review</i>)<br><br>Each and every chapter is chock full of illuminating and intriguing facts, and each one, rather than reserve the stage for one main actor, allows anyone who has something to say to take part in the fun. Stendhal, for instance, has two chapters devoted to his work--on his Romantic manifesto <i>Racine et Shakespeare</i> (1823), and another on his novel <i>La charteuse de Parme</i> (1893)--but his elegant shadow falls on dozens of other pages. Each chapter is announced by a date, a headline event and a theme, and is written by one of 165 academics collected by Hollier from both North America and Europe. And here one must marvel at Hollier's achievement: academics who can write both intelligently and with humor. The mind boggles. (Alberto Manguel <i>Globe and Mail</i>)<br><br>This grandly imagined and executed history of French literature is without precedent in any language...Here are many of the best contemporary critics and theorists, writing with vivid originality...This volume is a triumph of editorial and critical intelligence. (Richard Poirier <i>Raritan</i>)<br><br>The fact is that <i>A New History of French Literature</i> has rendered its predecessors obsolete. (Ernest Storm <i>French Review</i>)<br><br>Exciting, riotous, irritating, invigorating, often provocative, always interesting. (<i>L 'Humanit�-Dimanche</i>)<br><br>For the first time, Marie de France, Marguerite de Navarre, Germaine de Sta�l, George Sand, and Colette have come forward as prize-winners. (Claire Devarrieux <i>Liberation</i>)<br><br>After all the lights from the festivities have been extinguished, after all the babble from the colloquia has stilled, and the celebration of the bicentennial of the French Revolution on both sides of the Atlantic comes to an end, one book will remain--this one. (Pierre-Yves P�tillon <i>Critique</i>)</p><h2>Subjects of Desire</h2><p><p>This now classic work by one of the most important philosophers and critics of our time charts the trajectory of desire and its genesis from Hegel's formulation in <i>Phenomenology of Spirit</i> through its appropriation by Koj�ve, Hyppolite, Sartre, Lacan, Deleuze, and Foucault, presenting how French reception of Hegel posed successive challenges to his metaphysics and view of the subject and revealed ambiguities within his position. <i>Subjects of Desire</i> provides a sophisticated account of the post-Hegelian tradition that has predominated in modern France and remains timely in thinking about contemporary debates concerning desire, the unconscious, subjection, and the subject.</p></p><p><p>Judith Butler, Maxine Elliot Professor of Rhetoric and Comparative Literature at the University of California, Berkeley, is the author of many works, including <i>Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity</i>; <i>The Psychic Life of Power: Theories in Subjection</i>; and <i>Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative</i>.</p><p>What her account suggests is that the most damaging aspect of contemporary French Hegel reception is that its highly critical emphasis on the metaphysical issues of identity, rationality, and historical closure have so obscured Hegel's original idealism, especially his theory of reflection, that the rejection of Hegel brings with it, with a kind of dialectical necessity, the return of the <i>pre</i>-Hegelian, even the pre-Kantian, a kind of naive hope for 'immediacy' and, paradoxically, a commitment to a realism that the idealist tradition was to have finished off.</p> (Robert B. Pippin, <i>The Philosophical Review</i>)</p><h2>Jesus Among Other Gods: The Absolute Claims Of The Christian Message</h2><p>Using other religious traditions to make his case and contrasting Jesus with the founders of Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism, the author shows how the life and teachings of Jesus provide the template for life on Earth.</p><p><p>Ravi Zacharias is President and Founder of Ravi Zacharias International Ministries (RZIM).&nbsp; Their global outreach grew from humble roots in 1984 and includes fielding a team of itinerant speakers who operate from offices located around the world including the U.S., the UK, Romania, the Middle East, India, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Canada.&nbsp; The Hallmark of Ravi&#x2019;s heart is his strong evangelistic and apologetic that manifests itself from a position of compassion.</p>When Pope John Paul II called for a massive "new evangelization" of Asia during a November 1999 visit to India, his comments sparked protest from Hindus for whom proselytizing is a form of oppression. The debate underscored the sharp difference between Western creeds such as Christianity and Islam, which tend to be exclusive, and Eastern religions that stress pluralism. This collision forms a fascinating story line, and on that basis Zacharias's new work is superficially intriguing. Zacharias, a Christian apologist who grew up in India, does offer the occasional insight into Eastern religions. He claims that despite the current Hollywood romance with Buddhism as a simple faith of compassion, in most forms Buddhism is actually a complex system, featuring 227 disciplinary rules for men and 311 for women. Yet for the most part, Zacharias is in dialogue here not with Eastern religions but with Western skeptics. He seeks to settle old scores with Darwin and Hume, resurrecting tired debates over the nature of evil and the argument from design without adding anything new to the discussion. His theodicy will be convincing only to committed Christians, and his use of scripture is entirely uncritical (he points out grammatical and textual difficulties in the Koran without even mentioning analogous difficulties in the Bible). There are touching flashes of humanity as Zacharias describes suffering people he has encountered, but on the whole he does little to advance inter-religious conversation.

Her famous portraits of the poets Maximilian Voloshin and Andrei Bely reveal her remarkable capacities as an eyewitness, while her moving accounts of her father and mother, sisters and brother, seen through a child&#x2019;s eyes, comprise the most lyrical of family chronicles. The final section of the book, juxtaposing two works of literary criticism, demonstrates her formidable critical and analytical intelligence. <p>Tsvetaeva composed her prose to be read aloud, and these essays, full of extrodinary vitality, reflect the urgency of one who writes to discover the essential truths hidden in the past. A Captive Spirit is a remarkable collection of work from, as Vladimir Nabokov described her, "a writer of genius."</p></p><p>A Captive Spirit shows Marina Tsvetaeva&#x2019;s genius at the peak of its power. The selections are from her mature period, the 1930&#x2019;s, and include almost all of her autobiographical writings, her major literary portraits, and her literary criticism.Marina Tsvetaeva was born in Moscow in 1892. Her first volume of poetry was published in 1910 and attracted notice from some of the most important critics and poets in Russia, including Maximilian Voloshin. In 1922, following the Russian Civil War, she went into exile in Paris, where she became one of the leading writers of the emigre community. In 1939, she returned to the Soviet Union, and her husband was arrested shortly thereafter and subsequently executed by the NKVD. Tsvetaeva committed suicide in Elabuga, a small town to which she had been evacuated following the onset of World War II, in 1941.</p><h2>The Science of Discworld III: Darwin&#39;s Watch</h2><p>The wizards discover to their cost that it&#x2019;s no easy task to change history.<br><br>Roundworld is in trouble again, and this time it looks fatal.

He lives in McLean, Virginia.Celebrity-watchers keep tabloids in business hoping to catch a glimpse of the "real" side of favorite movie stars. This scattershot memoir by Dean Martin's youngest son proves that sometimes the image on the screen is a lot more colorful than the father who comes home and enjoys a slice of bread before dinner. Martin's affectionate, innocuous and slightly dull book of memories will be a treat only for true Dino fans, affording them an intimate look at the performer at home. The anecdotes have an "I guess you had to be there" flavor ("One of Dad's favorite jokes, which he would pull when we went out to dinner, was to be having a conversation and absent-mindedly butter his big hands as if they were pieces of bread") that should appeal to those who enjoy the humor in Reader's Digest. The younger Martin's focus is strictly Dino-as-Dad, with very few peeks into his father's work on screen or in the recording studio. Life at 601 Mountain Drive was pretty idyllic, with parents who didn't mind their kids shooting guns inside the house and who were blas&#x201a; when older son Dean Paul bought a tank. The latter part of the book is sparked to life by a too-close-for-comfort association with Charles Manson and the tragic fatal plane crash of Dean Paul, which precipitated Dino's health deterioration.

Focusing on the life and art of Irene Wellington -- considered one of the truly original figures in the development of calligraphy in our century -- it also provides a history of calligraphy&#39;s development into the vibrant and dynamic art form it is today. The four contributors to this volume, themselves noted calligraphers, help to tell the story of Wellington&#39;s life and work, illustrate her methods and techniques, assess her legacy and place it in the context of twentieth century calligraphy. Their work makes this an essential resource for any present or future calligraphers.</p><p>Wellington's calligraphy has been praised for its absolute rightness of design, its liveliness and grace, its easy fusion of writing and decoration. This pioneer of the British arts-and-crafts movement could turn a listing of 400 bailiffs into an elegant piece of abstract design. A Christmas carol penned on parchment sings with understated dignity, while a calligraphic collage of animals and alphabet fragments astonishes with its freewheeling spontaneity. Wellington, who died in 1984, did commissioned pieces for the British royal family. Her copybooks, penned quotations and book illustrations reveal her sureness of touch. The most personal pieces are whimsical cards made for friends, full of witty decorations. This album includes 125 color reproductions of her writings and illuminations. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Black Mass: The Irish Mob, The FBI and A Devil&#39;s Deal</h2><p>Explores the relationship between FBI agent John Connolly and Irish mob boss James &#34;Whitey&#34; Bulger, chronicling a corrupt arrangement of information, racketeering, and murder.</p><p>In the spring of 1988, <i>Boston Globe</i> reporters Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill set out to write the story of two infamous brothers from the insular Irish enclave of South Boston: Jim "Whitey" Bulger and his younger brother Billy. Whitey was the city's most powerful gangster and a living legend--tough, cunning, without conscience, and above all, smart. Billy, president of the state Senate, was a political heavyweight in Massachusetts. These facts alone make for an intriguing story, but as Lehr and O'Neill found out, this was only the beginning. <p> John Connolly, a rising FBI agent and fellow "Southie," had known the Bulgers since boyhood when Whitey rescued him from a playground fight. After investigating organized crime in New York, Connolly was reassigned to the bureau's Boston office in 1975, and was determined to make a name for himself by relying on his old connections. He succeeded in a big way by lining up Whitey as an FBI informant in an effort to bring down the Italian Mafia--a major coup for both the FBI and Connolly. In exchange, Bulger received protection. Though heavily involved in extortion, intimidation, assassination, and drug trafficking, Connolly's "good bad guy" did not receive so much as a traffic infraction for over 20 years. In time, however, the deal changed, and information began flowing the other direction, with Bulger manipulating Connolly and a small group of corrupt FBI agents to further his nefarious network. The criminals and the lawmen eventually became virtually indistinguishable. </p><p> <i>Black Mass</i> expertly details the twists and turns of this complex story, painting a vivid portrait of Boston's underbelly and its inclusive political machine, as well as exposing one of the worst scandals in FBI history. It's also an examination of loyalty--to family, home, and heritage--and "a cautionary tale about the abuse of power that goes unchecked." As a final favor, Connolly tipped off Bulger that he was to be indicted on racketeering charges in 1995, allowing him time to go on the lam (he's reported to have access to secret bank accounts across the country). He was added to the FBI's "Ten Most Wanted List" in 1999. <i>--Sharon M.

The Circle Ritz's condominium and apartment building's white marble facade looked cool and calm in the blazing July heat.<br>She eyed the flat Timex watch that almost covered her wrist. Punctuality was essential to Temple's work. She had no time for fancy, deceiving little watch faces that she couldn't read accurately at a glance. Good. Only twelve-twenty.<br>She got out, clicked around to the passenger's side and finally wrestled Midnight Louie's carrier through the gaping car door. Her credit card might be a hundred and forty dollars lighter, but she could swear the carrier was heavier than before. Perhaps this was the result of passive resistance; Louie had been silent and ominously still all the way home from the vet's.<br>Tilting to balance the carrier's weight, she struggled toward the condominium's back gate. Three steps took her into silk-searing sunlight. Temple could feel her hot pink top bleaching and the crown of her red hair fading to pink.<br>She was a tiny woman who didn't like to be reminded of it, not even by herself. So she gritted her teeth and took one laboring step after another, counting each one. The high heels didn't encourage efficient locomotion while toting overweight cats, but elevation was enough of an issue with her that she didn't mind. Three, four, five steps...uh. Maybe Matt Devine was by the pool working on his tan and his physique, both already perfect, but why stop now? He could help her with Louie. No, she could make it herself. Eight, nine, ten steps. The gate. Ah.<br>She eased the case to the hot concrete and sighed as her shoulder joint assumed its normal alignment. The vet was right; Louie desperately needed a diet.<br>A distant droning she took for bees in the honeysuckle vine draping the pierced concrete wall grew louder. Temple frowned and eyed the cat carrier. Was Louie growling again? He had not accepted his trip to the vet in the best of graces. The noise increased into a surflike roar.<br>Temple peered through her sunglasses toward the side street as the roar crested, then slowed into a chatter. Something large, silver and meaner-looking than a robotic junkyard dog, Terminator-style, turned into the driveway and rolled directly toward Temple.<br>She felt the nasty little twinge motorcycles had inspired since <i>The Wild Bunch</i>. They conjured visions of Nazis and Hell's Angels. Today's anonymous riders, now helmeted with obscuring black visors, did nothing to improve the image.<br>This motorcyclist wore a black nylon windbreaker and rolled its mount right up to Temple, the engine still clattering.<br>Temple eyed machine and rider, ready to dash through the gate should it or he/she jump either the concrete car-stop or her person. Then she read the hot-pink words emblazoned over the smoked-Plexiglas visor.<br>"<i>Speed Queen</i>?" Temple articulated incredulously.<br>The engine died with a final clank as the rider's ankle-boot-clad feet hit hot asphalt. One hand lifted from the handles and whipped up the visor.<br>Electra Lark's genial sixtyish face peered past the bowling ball of silver metallic paint that covered her head. She was grinning like a Halloween pumpkin.<br>"Just me. And wait a minute. You gotta see this." Electra slung a leg over the long black leather seat and engaged the kick stand as soon as she stood on her own two feet.<br>Temple watched nervously as the older woman stepped away from the motorcycle. It tilted but did not tumble. At her high-heeled feet, Louie growled warning. No chattering silver metal beast was going to intimidate him, not even after a dose of something as civilizing as "shots."<br>"A beauty, isn't it?" Electra demanded.<br>"If you like cold steel."<br>"Hot steel, honey."<br>"It will be if you leave it parked in this noonday sun for long."<br>"Oh, no! This baby will shelter in the shade of the gardening shed at the back."<br>"Has it always been kept there?"<br>Electra's open glance shifted. "Not always. But it'll be coming out a lot more now. I just got my license today."<br>"Hey, that's wonderful!" Temple was always primed to applaud another person's self-improvement program. "It can't be easy to drive one of these monsters. But, Electra...why?"<br>The woman pulled off the sinister helmet, revealing a spiky crew cut of silver hair ending in a long pigtail in back. On most late-middle-aged women such a hairdo would seem a pathetic attempt at kicky youth; on Electra it looked funky and even elegant.<br>Electra's head tilted until her ear cuffs chimed. She eyed the silver motorcycle and tried, "Because it was there?"<br>"But <i>why</i> was it there?" Temple persisted with the determination of an ex-TV reporter. "You never mentioned having one. I've never seen--or even more to the point, <i>heard</i> it before."<br>Electra's hand patted the leather seat as if stroking the flank of a favorite steed. "It was Max's."<br>"Max's?" Temple hadn't meant to sound sharp, or shocked, but she did. Both.<br>Electra's silver-metal boot toe kicked the asphalt. "A cycle's real practical with all the traffic jams in Vegas. And it is a beauty."<br>Temple stared at the thing as if it had landed from Mars. "I had no idea that Max liked--had--a motorcycle."<br>"Hey, he used it as the down payment on the condo."<br>Temple eyed her landlady incredulously. She was getting tired of learning things about Max after he was gone--long gone. Four months gone without a goodbye, with no explanation.<br>"Speaking of the condo," Temple began uncomfortably, "I had to take Louie to the vet and it cost a fortune. I might be .a little late with the monthly maintenance money, but not the mortgage."<br>"Don't worry about it, dear." Electra's waving hand ignited a shower of glints from the many rings mailing her fingers. "I know it's tough when suddenly one person is paying on a place instead of two. Besides, according to folks who know their motorcycles, this baby is worth major moola. It's a classic."<br>"How classic can a motorcycle get?"<br>"Plenty. It's a Hesketh Vampire."<br>"No wonder it gave me the shivers when I heard it coming. Why on earth is it called a vampire?"<br>"Maybe because it sounds dangerous. It howls in prime gear when the wind whistles by."<br>Temple shook her head. "Hesketh Vampire," she repeated numbly. "Any relation to a Sopwith Camel?"<br>"Well, it is British-made." Electra proudly circled her new toy, ticking off its assets. "A full-liter engine, one thousand cee-cees. Nickel-plated and overbuilt to go literally millions of miles."<br>Temple followed Electra around the massive machine, eyeing the steeply raked windshield, the fluid silver front casing--not shiny like chrome but matte-soft, classy--and the emblem of a crown surmounted by an angry rooster head above the Cyclopean front headlight.<br>"<i>Max</i> had this, really?"<br>"Yup." Electra's finger stroked the word "Hesketh" under the regal but surly rooster. "The famous Hesketh flying chicken. Now it's chicken � la queen." She chuckled and lifted her emblazoned helmet.<br>Temple just shook her head. "I don't know much about motorcycles--and apparently knew even less about Max--but this is a humongous machine, Electra. Is it safe to drive?"<br>"Ride," Electra corrected quickly. "Driving is for sissies."<br>"Can a woman handle it safely?"<br>"Safety is not the idea with a superbike, dear," Electra explained sweetly.<br>"But a woman your age--"<br>"A woman my age can use a little excitement. They say women are horse-crazy, but those ninnies are living in the last century. This thing rides like a rocket. Besides, it's a good way to meet men, if you're so inclined. I found me some guys who knew something about cycles and they taught me the ropes."<br>"Where'd you find bikers?"<br>"They're not bikers, just some older guys who tinker a bit. Wild Blue works mostly on vintage planes, but Eight-ball has played with a bike or two."<br>"Eightball? Not Eightball O'Rourke?"<br>"Yeah, how'd you know him?"<br>"He's the private detective I hired to tail the ABA cat-napper."<br>Electra looked bemused. "No kidding? Until not too long ago, he and his pals were fugitives."<br>"Fugitives? Eightball claimed he had a security background."<br>Electra nodded sagely. "And so he does; nobody around Las Vegas has been as secure as Eightball all these years. He and the Glory Hole Gang hid out in the desert looking for some silver dollars they hijacked during World War Two and hid so good they couldn't find them again themselves. Buried treasure. The statute of limitations had run out by the time anyone found out about them, and now they run Glory Hole as a tourist ghost town; it's in that string of abandoned towns off of Highway 95.1 think Eightball got so used to looking for that lost treasure that he decided to get into the business of looking into this and that. Hooked on hunting, if you know what I mean."<br>"But he had a license, he said he'd been employed in detection for years!"<br>"What would you say if you had a dicey background and were trying something new at age seventy or so?"<br>"I can't believe you know these people, Electra."<br>Electra eyed Temple for a long moment. "I'm not responsible for what my friends or acquaintances do or did, but these are sweet old guys. Helped me out a lot, for nothing. They even had to chop the seat padding down so my legs could reach the ground." She slapped the black leather again, and Temple winced. "Hated to do it, but face it, Max isn't coming back. No sense letting a primo machine rot."<br>"Right," Temple murmured fervently.<br>"Heck," Electra added, "I bet even you could ride my new baby with the seat this low. Come on, hop on. I'll take you for a spin around the block."<br>"No, thanks." Temple turned to inspect her own "baby" in his vetmobile. "Louie needs to get his breakfast just as soon as I can tote in the twenty-pound bag in the trunk. I'll pass."<br>"Chicken?" Electra grinned wickedly, donning her helmet.<br>Temple didn't honor that with a direct answer. "I've got a lot of work to get out on my computer before the WICA meeting at five-thirty. Sorry. Some other time," she added with rare insincerity.<br>Electra's platinum-gray eyebrows lofted nearly to the helmet's brim. "Wicca? I didn't know you were interested in witchcraft."<br>"I'm not. It's Women in Communications, Associated. Great for networking, and digging up freelance clients in the recession is more like doing black magic than white witchcraft."<br>"I wouldn't joke about the dark arts, dearie," Electra said with a shudder, flipping her sinister visor down.<br>Despite needing to hustle, Temple couldn't resist waiting to watch the landlady mount, expertly kick away the support, start the engine and chatter off in low gear to the shed around back.<br>Then she glumly lugged Louie through the gate, shut it and headed across the area bordering the pool, relieved that Matt Devine wasn't in sight.<br>She couldn't believe that Max had never mentioned that thing, much less using it for a down payment on the condo....He had glossed over that issue when he'd put the place in both their names. Electra was financing it, so it was simple--if not monetarily easy--for Temple to take over the payments after Max skedaddled. And here Temple had hoped buying instead of renting had indicated that Max was as serious about permanent relationships as she was...hah!<br>While these thoughts festered, her autopilot had called the elevator, punched the proper floor and gotten her off before the doors sliced together on her or Louie's carrier.<br>She walked down the semicircular hall to her door, unlocked it and sat Louie's carrier on the entry-hall parquet. When she opened the grille, he sulked inside, reduced to a resentful glare of electric green eyes.<br>"Sorry, boy. I'll feed you as soon as I drag the bag back from the car."<br>She was back in minutes, staggering, to find the carrier empty and Louie nowhere in sight. Temple sighed, slung the huge brown-paper bag to the kitchen countertop and proceeded to exercise her nails on trying to puncture the stitched-shut top. She finally fetched the kitchen shears and took several ill-tempered stabs at the tough paper until she worried a ragged hole in one corner.<br>Then she hefted the heavy bag and squatted to pour its contents into Louie's empty banana split dish. Green-brown pellets plugged the hole, then burped out in a dirty hail, scattering like run-amok marbles on the black and white tiles.<br>"Oh, holy horseradish! This feline health food is gonna break my back. Louie! Come and get it."<br>He refused to show, so Temple stomped into her bedroom to look under the bed. Nothing animal there but dust bunnies. The louvered closet doors were shut, but she jerked one open just the same. Jerk. Speaking of which, there was Max, face-to-face.<br>She studied the glossy, oversized poster she knew like the markings on her mauve snakeskin J. Renees. By now, Max, the most mobile of men both mentally and physically, had become frozen into this single, hype-ridden image: black turtleneck, black unruly hair, green stare. The Mystifying Max, vanished magician, former roommate, lost lover. Was he ever.<br>And now his past recycled: a massive silver Vampire on wheelies. It must have meant something to him, owning a classic. He must have ridden it at one time; left it behind when his act toured distant cities like Minneapolis. He must have figured a Heckwith, or whatever, Vampire wasn't Temple's speed, or he'd have kept it, shown it to her. Said, Hop on, I'll take you for a ride. He hadn't needed a motorcycle for that.<br>Temple sat suddenly on the bed, still staring at the poster. She wasn't a motorcycle moll. She couldn't see herself roaring along the never-ending white center line on two narrow tires and a bloated black belly of steel. Maybe Max couldn't see that either. Maybe that's why he'd left; she was too conventional, took herself too seriously. Maybe she would have liked it, plastering herself behind Max, wrapped up in gear with a dark crystal ball for a crown and the wind rushing at them, the road running away behind them and speed thrumming with exultation between their conjoined thighs....<br>Temple rose, then used her long, lacquered nails to peel the tape very carefully from the four corners of the poster. She folded the excess tape down on the back before rolling the heavy paper into one long white cylinder. Then she stuffed it down in the far dark back corner of the closet where the last of Max's clothes hung waiting to be taken to the Goodwill someday.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright �1993 by Carole Nelson Douglas</p><h2>The Pride of Chanur</h2><p><p>No one at Meetpoint Station had ever seen a creature like the Outsider.

By March 1943, defeats at Midway and Guadalcanal had checked the progress of the Japanese Imperial Navy after its dizzying victories over American, British, and Dutch naval forces in the early stages of the war. Nonetheless, the presence of Japanese forces in New Guinea stubbornly continued to threaten Australia. In particular, despite some reverses in New Guinea, the Imperial Army continued to hold Lae, a strategic position on the coast of northeast New Guinea, and planned to deliver a formidable armed force to Lae by convoy. As a result of American intercepts of Japanese coded messages (and inspired guesswork by American general George Kenney and Australian commander ``Blackjack'' Walker), the Allied air forces--a motley band of Australians and Americans flying a makeshift collection of aircraft--were able to attack and destroy the convoy without major losses. McAulay's narrative is largely a description of this destruction, from the point of view of both Allied fliers and Japanese soldiers and sailors (the author's extensive use of Japanese diaries is fascinating and effective). However, while McAulay's account is informative and forthright, his prose style becomes turgid at times; and he fails to discuss adequately the strategic importance of the battle (which represented the final defeat of the Japanese military in its drive toward Australia). Nonetheless, the inherent drama of the story makes for compelling reading about an important and oft-neglected naval engagement.

All rights reserved.</i>How significant could a single, three-day World War II air-sea battle be when considering the entire history of the war? McAulay succeeds in highlighting this battle in his exciting story set in the Southwest Pacific Area (SWPA) of the war. McAulay first sets the stage for the battle and then vividly presents the action from the perspective of the American and Australian pilots and Japanese sailors who fought and died in the carnage. This contribution to military history reminds us that war in the air and on the sea is no less horrific than on the ground. The battle was a solid defeat for the Japanese and further entrenched Allied air power in the SWPA, speeding up the eventual successful end of the war. The role of Allied 5th Air Force Commander Kenney in this successful campaign is also a useful addition to the massive material on World War II.

Here Perry Woodson Hatfield James, torn between family honour and the lure of seedy &#34;watering holes&#34; must somehow survive the tempestuous journey from boyhood to manhood and escape the dark heritage of the Cumberland Mountains in this &#39;surging, bitter novel as authentic as moonshine&#39; (New York Times)</p><p>James Lee Burke is a&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author, two-time winner of the Edgar Award, and the recipient of the Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Arts in Fiction. He&#x2019;s authored thirty-six novels and two short story collections.&nbsp;He lives in Missoula, Montana.To the Bright and Shining Sun <br> <br>CHAPTER<br> <br> <br> <br>ONE<br> <br>THREE MEN AND a boy sat in the dark in a battered 1958 Ford on a shale road that wound along the base of the mountain. One of them smoked a hand-rolled cigarette in the cup of his hands, bending down his head below the level of the windows whenever he drew in the smoke. The first leaves were shedding from the trees, and they rattled dryly along the road in the wind. Around the curve of the road was the coal tipple, huge and looming over the railway tracks that led past the mine opening down towards the switch where the C &amp; O made up the long freight cars that would eventually take the coal to Pittsburgh. The boy, Perry Woodson Hatfield James, sat in the backseat with one hand gripped tightly under his thigh and the other over his wrist. He could feel the sweat form under his arms and run cold down his sides. He believed that if fear had a smell it would already have soaked through his clothes and permeated everything in the car. He could smell it in himself every time he took a breath. It was a rancid odor, like something dead in the sun. Big J.W. and Little J.W. sat in the front, immobile against the glow of the moon except when Little J.W. bent to smoke off the cigarette. They were half brothers, both fathered by a North Carolina moonshiner who was killed at the age of seventy-six in the dirt streets of Harlan while giving whiskey free to the miners when John L. Lewis first organized the coal fields and the National Guard was sent in by the state to shoot down a man who tried to stop a scab from crossing the picket.<br> <br>Big J.W. wore a tin hat down low on his forehead, and his skin was grained with coal dust, rubbed so deep around the corners of his eyes that it looked like a burn. The faded pinstriped coat he wore over his overalls was stretched almost to tearing across his angular shoulders, and the knobs on his wrist looked like white bones sticking out of his sleeves. His teeth were yellow and long, and his fingernails were as thick and hard as tortoiseshell, broken to the quick and colored with blue-black half-moons. His wife cut his hair with a straight-edged razor, and it hung unevenly over the back of his neck like a girl&#x2019;s. Little J.W. was a small round man with a hard, little, round stomach that pushed against his work trousers. He was thought to be an invaluable man in the mines because he could go a half mile up and down a narrow shaft on his hands and knees like a groundhog. His soft, brown eyes and quiet mountain accent caused few people to pay any particular attention to him except when there was an explosion or cave-in down in the hole and somebody was needed to crawl through the fallen limestone and timbers to some gas-filled pocket deep in the earth where no sane person would go. But those who knew him well realized that he was a much more dangerous person than Big J.W., and when set in motion he would go at something or someone with the quiet rage of a hot iron scorched across wood. Once, he and an uncle argued while drinking, and after the uncle drew a knife, Little J.W. hit him six times in the head with a poker and threw him off the front porch of the company cabin into the yard. &#x201c;Pull a knife on me, will you,&#x201d; he said, the poker still in his hand. &#x201c;Pull one against your own blood, will you. Well, if you get home by yourself that&#x2019;s all right with me, and by God if you die out here in the lot that&#x2019;s all right with me, too.&#x201d;<br> <br>On the back floor of the car, under a blanket, were a lever-action 30-caliber Winchester, a double-barreled twelve-gauge with the barrels sawed off two inches in front of the chambers, fourteen cans of dynamite, three primers, and a four-hundred-foot spool of cap wire. The boy also knew that each of the three men with him carried a .38, since they would no more leave home without it than they would without their trousers.<br> <br>&#x201c;It ain&#x2019;t we got to blow it,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Maybe just set it up on the mountain and push some rock down on the hole.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I done told you, honey,&#x201d; Big J.W. said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re a-blowing that tipple right over on the moneyman&#x2019;s head. We didn&#x2019;t risk no year in Frankfort breaking open the shack just to move some rock around.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Moon&#x2019;s a-setting,&#x201d; Little J.W. said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Get them charges out, Perry,&#x201d; Bee, the man next to the boy, said. He was the boy&#x2019;s uncle, a tall man who had to stoop slightly so his head wouldn&#x2019;t hit the top of the car. Like Big J.W., he wore overalls, with a leather belt around his waist, and a suitcoat and a cloth slug cap on his head. Years ago he had lost his dentures, and his mouth was collapsed in rows of thick creases around his lips. His gums were blackened from the wad of snuff that was always under his tongue. During the forties he did two years in the Kentucky penitentiary for shooting a company deputy, and because he had refused to name any of the other men who shot three more company men in the same battle, he was made a business agent for the United Mine Workers when he was paroled. He rasped and coughed into his sleeve. He&#x2019;d had silicosis since he was twenty-five from working in the mines before the companies had been forced to put ventilation systems in the shaft.<br> <br>&#x201c;What if them scabs is there?&#x201d; Perry said.<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re a-going right with it,&#x201d; Big J.W. said. &#x201c;They can steal food out of a man&#x2019;s mouth down in hell if they&#x2019;ve still a mind for it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bee tore the blanket off the explosives and guns. &#x201c;Now you build them charges,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;By God, there ain&#x2019;t nobody saying a James or a Hatfield puts a scab before a workingman.&#x201d;<br> <br>The boy screwed the cans end to end, tightening each socket securely. He built the charges in cylinders of four cans each, with a primer on the butt end of each row. The sweat on his hands was cold against the metal. There&#x2019;s enough here to put half the mountain down in the holler, he thought. Them four hundred feet of wire ain&#x2019;t even going to give us running distance. We&#x2019;ll be a-setting here with rocks big as cars coming down on us. I seen them drop a charge like this on Black Mountain in Harlan once, and the trees and rocks burst all over the sun. The dust stayed black across the crest of the ridge until twilight when it started to rain. He wished he was back home in the cabin now, with the dry poplar logs and huge coal lumps burning in the blackened sandstone fireplace. He was too afraid to care whether he worked union or not. Maybe the operator ain&#x2019;t wrong, he thought. Maybe he can&#x2019;t afford to pay scale, and it ain&#x2019;t nothing but trouble to push union in the coal field. We was doing all right with what they was giving us. Twelve dollars a day is more than we&#x2019;re a-getting on the picket. There wasn&#x2019;t no shooting and no company men coming around the houses asking where the men was at the night before. We didn&#x2019;t have nobody cutting off our charge at the store. And on Saturday afternoon a feller had a hard dollar in his pocket to ride the bus into Winfro Valley for the Barn Dance that&#x2019;s over the radio.<br> <br>Then he felt an old secret shame inside him at his fear. His people had been against the operator since his grandfather had had his mineral rights stolen out from under him for fifty cents an acre by a New York sharper&#x2014;an eastern feller, with a gold watch that must have cost a hundred dollars hanging on his vest, his grandfather had said. He set down at your table and told ye how good your fatback and greens was and how the half dollar would pay the county tax and said the land wasn&#x2019;t good for anything no way. Bought up the whole holler for no more than the price of that train ticket from New York. And didn&#x2019;t tell nobody that what ye signed give the operator the right to do whatever he wanted to the top of the land. They could tear away the mountain and let it slide all across your tobacco crop, there wasn&#x2019;t nothing ye could do about it except go to work for him.<br> <br>Perry knew that no James or Hatfield in his family had ever been afraid of operators, company thugs, strikebreakers with their axe handles, or even the National Guard. His grandfather said he was related to Frank James, the outlaw who hid out in the Cumberland after robbing a bank with Jesse over in West Virginia, and his mother was a direct descendant of Devil Anse Hatfield, who killed McCoys all over Pike and Logan counties. His family had been union people even before John L. Lewis and the CIO organized the coal field. They had fought side by side with the organizers from the National Miners Union before the Great Depression, when the man who breathed the word &#x201c;union&#x201d; was fired from his job, evicted from his company-owned cabin, maybe run out of the county by the sheriff, and sometimes shot and thrown down the hollow.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s dark enough now,&#x201d; Big J.W. said. &#x201c;Hand baby brother up the shotgun.&#x201d;<br> <br>Perry gave Little J.W. the sawed-off double-barrel and watched against the door.<br> <br>The entrance to the mine was a dark, square gap in the face of the mountain. Farther down, a huge slag heap was smoking in the cold. Since the time he was a small child Perry could not remember ever having been near a mine without smelling the odor of burning slag. It was a fire that never went out because its source of fuel was never stopped, and the air around his home always had the same acrid stench to it. The coal from the tipple spilled across the road into a black slide and down the gulley into a stream. Next to the road a discarded sign on a wooden stick, left from the day&#x2019;s picketing, was propped at an angle against a rock. It read in crude, hand-printed letters: this mine unfair it dont hire union men.<br> <br>&#x201c;They didn&#x2019;t leave no guard,&#x201d; Little J.W. said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Watch that opening. Them scabs might be a-drawing right down on my windshield now,&#x201d; Big J.W. said. &#x201c;Remember when they shot up Noah Combs? He never knew where they was at till he was right up on the shaft.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bee took the .38 special from the bib pocket of his overalls and let it rest in his palm against his leg. Big J.W. drove past the tipple a hundred yards and stopped the car under an overhang of pine trees. The base of the burning slag heap glowed red in the breeze. Down in the hollow Perry could hear the bats squeaking through the darkness as they swept in circles over the creek.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do no talking when we&#x2019;re out of the car,&#x201d; Big J.W. said. &#x201c;And if you see a scab, drop him fast before he gets off a shot. He hits one of them primers and they&#x2019;ll have to scrub us off the mountain.&#x201d;<br> <br>The four of them got out of the car onto the road. The wind against the sweat on Perry&#x2019;s face made him cold. He and Big J.W. each carried two sticks of charges; they held the spool of cap wire between them with an iron pipe stuck through the center. They moved up the mountain towards the tipple, over the scattered lumps of coal and slag. The rocks rolling down under their boots and hands sounded to Perry like an avalanche crashing into the hollow. There ain&#x2019;t no sense in it, he thought. You ain&#x2019;t got to blow half the county to let them know we wasn&#x2019;t working for no one-twenty-five. There ain&#x2019;t going to be no work anyhow when the tipple goes.<br> <br>Before they got to the base of the tipple, Little J.W. and Bee dropped to one knee and pointed their guns to each side of the structure. Bee held his .38 straight ahead of him, with his left hand gripped around his wrist to steady his aim. The boy and Big J.W. moved up to the steel stanchions sunk in concrete that supported the weight of the tipple. Perry&#x2019;s fingers felt thick and uncoordinated as he and Big J.W. placed the charges around a stanchion on the downhill side of the mountain and wrapped them securely with baling wire. Big J.W. pulled the end of the cap wire loose from the spool and carefully set the small plastic tube of gelatin detonator across a primer head and wound it over with electrician&#x2019;s tape. Then he took the spool of wire and made two turns around the bottom of the stanchion and tied a sailor&#x2019;s bowknot in it so that the tube of gelatin would not pull loose when they strung the wire downhill.<br> <br>Big J.W. grabbed the boy&#x2019;s arm hard and pulled him into a crouch beside him. Several rocks rolled past them from above. They waited in the dark, hardly breathing, while the bats squeaked and whirled above them. Little J.W. and Bee looked like carved soldiers, frozen in their positions. Run now, the boy thought. Drop the wire and take off across the road into the holler. It ain&#x2019;t cowardice to run from getting shot at. People in wars do it. They didn&#x2019;t say nothing about shooting. It ain&#x2019;t fair to get shot at when you ain&#x2019;t got a gun.<br> <br>&#x201c;Set, boy,&#x201d; Big J.W. whispered fiercely, his hand tightening on Perry&#x2019;s arm.<br> <br>&#x201c;We can&#x2019;t even see them.

Perry felt that even if a small rock was set in motion by the point of his boot, a volley of shotgun and rifle fire would open up that would blow him backwards like a pile of rags onto the road.<br> <br>&#x201c;Start stringing it,&#x201d; Big J.W. said. They crawled down the mountain between the two other men while Big J.W. pulled the cap wire off the spool with one hand and laid it out evenly behind them. Bee&#x2019;s extended arm was as rigid as a thick piece of wood as he kept his pistol pointed towards the top of the rise, his jaws sucking slowly on the saliva-smooth lump of snuff in his mouth. He started to cough once and pressed his palm across his face, spitting tobacco juice all over himself in a dry rasp. Perry knew that somewhere up there in the dark a man had the V-sight of a carbine lined in on the nape of his neck, and involuntarily he kept touching the back of his head with his hand. I wouldn&#x2019;t be afraid if they give me a gun, he thought. Them company guards ain&#x2019;t likely to stick to a fight when they get shot back at. Big J.W. wouldn&#x2019;t be a-grabbing on to me like he was something unless he had that special in his pocket.<br> <br>He felt that a gun would be like a piece of magic in his pocket. He knew the heart-pounding and heavy breathing would stop if he could feel a .38 stuck hard down inside his trousers with the hammer on half cock. A gun was something smooth and lovely that fitted into the curve of a man&#x2019;s palm as though it were an extension of his arm. You could hold scabs and company deputies at a distance with it, and you didn&#x2019;t have to be afraid of a man letting off a shotgun at you from the dark opening of a mine shaft. Noah Combs wouldn&#x2019;t have been shot up if he&#x2019;d had his revolver in his hand rather than in his glove compartment when the company guards hit him from both sides of the road.<br> <br>Perry and Big J.W. made the road and strung out the last of the wire to the automobile. Big J.W. unlatched the hood, raised it carefully, and pulled the cap off of a spark plug. Little J.W. and Bee moved backwards down the mountain, with their guns still pointed in front of them. The mountains looked cold as iron. The black trunks of the trees and the sharp rock walls of the cliffs were beginning to coat with ice. The boy&#x2019;s feet felt like stone. J.W. opened his pocketknife and shaved off the insulation from the end of the cap wire. He pulled the wire apart in two sections and wrapped the exposed metal strands around the head of the spark plug and replaced the rubber cap.<br> <br>It ain&#x2019;t too late, the boy thought.

Robert LeVine, an eminent Harvard anthropologist, determined that parents around the world universally share three goals in raising their children. The first goal is survival and health: Parents want their children to stay alive. For those who live in societies where they can be reasonably sure of being able to meet children&#x2019;s most basic survival needs past infancy, though, the second universal goal is to raise children who will have the basic skills they&#x2019;ll need to sustain themselves economically once they grow up. And finally, there&#x2019;s the goal of self-maximization&#x2014;of raising a socially competent child who possesses the cultural values that are considered important, and who will succeed in that society: <i>a child who will thrive</i>.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t know if I would ever have a child. Pregnancy didn&#x2019;t come easily to me, and my husband, David, and I experienced the heartache of infertility before conceiving our first baby. But I always loved children and longed for the day I might become a mother. When I finally became pregnant, survival was a question: I hemorrhaged so severely in my seventh month that doctors told us the pregnancy was in danger. It wasn&#x2019;t until tiny Benjamin was born and safely in my arms, when I looked at his face with his wide brown eyes, mop of black hair, and the puzzled expression that elicited such fierce protectiveness inside me, that I started to think about what kind of parent I would be and how I could best raise a child who would not only survive but also thrive.</p><p>My parents immigrated to the United States from South Korea shortly before I was born in 1968. Growing up in the 1970s in small-town Pennsylvania, I straddled two cultures every day of my childhood. In some ways my parents were very Korean in how they raised us: We used chopsticks at the dinner table; kimchi, seaweed, and rice were staples in our home; I was taught not to call adults by their first names and to behave respectfully toward older relatives. Education was highly valued in our house and we were expected to complete our homework on time and get good grades. Sometimes this felt like a lot of pressure. At the same time, my parents had a broad perspective and were enthusiastic and relaxed about the things my brothers and I wanted to do, whether it was make our own Halloween costumes, pretend to pan for gold in a creek, watch movies for hours with our friends, or eat or read whatever we wanted. When I look back on my childhood, I am actually astounded by how little my parents questioned the things we were doing with our time and where our lives were going, especially since our American small-town childhood was so different from their own.</p><p>They had their worries, as many immigrant families who strongly want their children to thrive in their new society often do. I remember hushed conversations between my mom and dad about whether we were really getting a good education, and get-togethers with other Korean immigrant families where parents exchanged questions about the schools their children were attending as they tried to navigate an alien school system. Sometimes our differences really compounded my self- consciousness about being one of the few Asian-American students in school. But like many American parents of my generation, I find myself looking back with amazement at a degree of freedom and acceptance that seems virtually lost today. Even though my parents always conveyed the value of holding high expectations, they gave us so much time and space to experiment, play, and just be. They were always trying to do their best for us. They believed in our potential to flourish. But they weren&#x2019;t always trying to mold and change us.</p><p>During my twenties I lived in Japan several times, first to study Japanese and then to do research for a doctorate in East Asian history. In a remote village nestled in the mountainous countryside, I met David, who, like me, was a student who had come to Japan to learn the language. When David and I returned to the United States and decided to get married, we also knew that we might eventually be going back to Japan one day and maybe even raising children there. No matter where our children would grow up, though, I knew I loved America. And I knew there were many things from my own Korean-American upbringing and my Jewish-American husband&#x2019;s that would shape our family&#x2019;s life.</p></p><h2>Crying in the Wilderness</h2><p><p>In this stunning collection of essays, many of them gleaned from back issues of some of the world's most notable magazines, others seen here for the first time, Pinckney sometimes seems like some wild-eyed Old Testament prophet crying in the wilderness, at other times, a man crying for it, grieving the loss of the wild places, on the earth and in the heart.</p></p><p>Roger Pinckney has traveled the world in search of adventure and has ofter found much more of it close to home.

He lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico.Erdoes, an illustrator and author, and Ortiz, a recently deceased Tewa Pueblo and distinguished professor of anthropology at the University of New Mexico, have compiled this anthology as a sequel to American Indian Myths and Legends (LJ 11/15/84). Some 106 tales, each identified with its tribe of origin, are divided into 14 parts arranged by theme. Additional information about the various tribes is provided in the appendix, which is arranged alphabetically. Many of the tales are reprinted from other sources and are thus not original. In addition, they are presented as if they were children's stories, so unfortunately the richness of Native American delivery is lost. Still, this is an extremely useful compilation for those libraries with a limited amount of Native American literature. The sexual nature of some of the stories and illustrations make this title inappropriate for school libraries. Recommended for public and academic libraries.?John Burch, Cumberland Coll.

She was then awarded an NSF postdoctoral fellowship in the Department of Molecular Biology at the University of New Mexico, followed by a Burroughs Wellcome Fund Postdoctoral Fellowship in the Department of Molecular Biology at the University of California, Berkeley. As Dr. Keller home schooled her three children, she was unable to find science textbooks that she felt would give her children a solid foundation in the sciences. Her scientific background, coupled with her desire to educate her children, led Dr. Keller to found Gravitas Publications, Inc. and to develop the Real Science-4-Kids curriculum. Real Science-4-Kids is a &#x201c;worldview-neutral&#x201d; curriculum that provides students with a solid foundation in the sciences and also gives them the tools to evaluate scientific data on their own. Students are presented with up-to-date scientific facts and the steps of the scientific method, together with the critical thinking tools needed to help them evaluate scientific conclusions. Dr. Keller&#x2019;s books are as philosophically neutral as possible and do not impose any single overall philosophical interpretation such as Darwinism, Intelligent Design, or Creationism. Instead, they allow students to make up their own minds about what the data show. Real Science-4-Kids, with its engaging, kid-friendly text and easy to use teacher-friendly manuals, is used in home, private, and public schools in all 50 states in the US and in many other countries.

All Parson and Gold have is each other, to stay alive. <br><br>It is a novel of relentless pace and constant surprise, not only in the turns of its plot but in the strength and fleetness of its prose. Thomas Young is a writer&#x2014;and this is the beginning of a brilliant career.</p><p><strong>Thomas Young on <i>The Mullah's Storm</i></strong> <p></p> <p> </p> <p> When writing fiction, your best work may come from what scares you the most: you take pen in hand and imagine the worst. When I first flew into Afghanistan, what scared me the most wasn't the thought of getting shot down and killed. It was the thought of getting shot down and not killed. </p> <p> For most aviators, an encounter with the enemy usually happens in the form of lights streaming up from the earth. It has an air of unreality about it, almost like a video game. If those lights don't hit you, they don't hurt you. But what if you had an airplane blown out from under you and you met the enemy on his terms, in his territory? What would you face on the ground? What would your buddies need you to do? Under conditions of extreme duress and hardship, would you make decisions you could live with later on? </p> <p> When I went to the Air Force Survival School years ago, an instructor gave a briefing I have never forgotten. He said, "Every Air Force flier shot down in Vietnam, captured, and dragged to the Hanoi Hilton sat right here in this auditorium and thought, 'It won't happen to me.'" </p> <p> I still think it won't happen to me. But if it did? <i>The Mullah's Storm</i> is an imagining of that fear. </p> <p> The book's action begins with the downing of a C-130 Hercules in Afghanistan, set at an indeterminate time in the war. It could have happened in 2001, or it might not have happened yet. A shoulder-fired missile blows my main characters out of their normal world and onto a journey that forces them to disregard personal safety and even personal loyalties for the sake of the mission. </p> <p> My fears have become reality for some service members, and the characters in The Mullah's Storm are composites of people I have known. One of those people was an early mentor and squadron mate who had served as a Marine Corps helicopter crew chief in Vietnam. He enjoyed target shooting, and I assumed such an avid marksman would also be a hunter. But when I invited him to go duck hunting, he declined. He said, "When I was shot down in Vietnam, I learned what it felt like to be hunted. I have never hunted anything since." </p> <p> Though my colleague's Vietnam ordeal echoes through the book, the characters draw their motivations and mindsets from veterans of the current wars. These service members, all volunteers, come from the best-educated military ever fielded. American troops have more skill and training than ever before, and their leaders have more confidence in them. They have more individual responsibility, and in extremis, more ability to act alone when necessary. They are not cynical, but neither are they na�ve about their missions and the mistakes of those who send them on those missions. </p> <p> Another difference with today's military is the greater contributions of women. Their presence as part of the team no longer raises eyebrows; in fact, it is taken for granted. My novel's female character, Sergeant Gold, was inspired by the women with whom I have served. Those real-life military women include some of the best pilots, navigators, and flight engineers I've known. </p> <p> Other characters are from a U.S. Army Special Forces team. As a C-130 flight engineer, I often had the pleasure of working with Special Forces. Sometimes we flew SF troops during their parachute training, dropping freefall jumpers from so high that they breathed from an oxygen bottle on the way down. In addition to their other military skills, each SF soldier is fluent in a foreign language. Those guys are very smart and very tough, and I've seen them face awful conditions with spirit and humor. </p> <p> I could have set this novel, or one very much like it, in Iraq or even Bosnia or Kosovo. But during airlift missions over Afghanistan, I was struck by the stark beauty of the country as seen from the air: snows of the Hindu Kush, great distances of mountains unmarked by so much as a dirt path, cold and clear night air lit by a meteor shower, rural expanses so dark the stars appeared not as scattered points but as silver dust. </p> <p> The book contains scenes of violence, and sadly, that reflects reality, both past and future. Afghanistan may never completely rid itself of insurgents and warlords, jihadists and opium traffickers. The Taliban will not show up on the deck of the USS Missouri to sign an instrument of surrender. Even if American forces end combat operations tomorrow, the country will need humanitarian assistance and airlift support into the foreseeable future. Whether U.S. troops stay or go, this will be a long war for the Afghans. </p> <p> Though the idea for <i>The Mullah's Storm</i> had been knocking around in my head for a while, it took an in-flight emergency to get me started on the actual writing. In August of 2007, I was part of a crew flying a routine airlift mission into Osan Air Base, South Korea. On the way, we lost a hydraulic system and a generator. We declared an emergency and landed safely, greeted by the flashing lights of the crash trucks. When we taxied to the ramp, the aircraft dripped a trail of hydraulic fluid. </p> <p> After we shut down, we learned we'd be stuck for days, waiting for parts. So with time to kill at Osan, one morning I went to the Base Exchange and bought a yellow legal pad and a cup of coffee. I sat on a couch in aircrew billeting, and I wrote at the top of the pad, "Chapter One." </p><p> <i>--Thomas W. Young</i> </p><p><strong>Thomas W.

Please!: How to Survive Caring for Aging Parents</h2><p>Elder Rage" is a Book-on-the-Month Club selection (a caregiving book first), receiving 500+ 5-Star Amazon reviews. It is a riveting, often LOL humorous, non-fiction novel chronicling Jacqueline Marcell's trials, tribulations, and eventual success at managing the care of her aging parents. "Elder Rage" is also an extensive self-help book with creative solutions for effective management medically, behaviorally, socially, legally, financially, and emotionally of challenging elders who resist care. <br><br>"Elder Rage" includes answers to difficult caregiving questions such as how to get obstinate elders to: accept cleaning and caregiving help, see a different doctor, give up driving, attend adult day care, eat, take medication, sleep and bathe properly, move to a new residence, and much more. Also an extensive Q&amp;A section, valuable resources and recommended reading. The extensive addendum by renowned neurologist/dementia specialist, Rodman Shankle, MS MD: A Physician's Guide to Treating Dementia, helped make "Elder Rage" required reading at numerous universities for courses in geriatric assessment and management.

She gave up her career as a television executive, went through 40 caregivers and cried rivers for a year before solving the endless crisis medically, behaviorally, socially, legally, financially and emotionally. Passion to save others from a similar experience resulted in her first book, "Elder Rage", a Book-of-the-Month Club selection receiving 50 prestigious endorsements, over 300 5-Star Amazon reviews, is required reading for courses in geriatric assessment and management, and being considered for a film. <p> Delivered with a humorous tone to make a tough subject palatable, Marcell relates how she fought through an unsympathetic medical system and endured her "Jekyll &amp; Hyde" father's wrath, until she finally found help for him and her ailing mother. What she didn't understand was that his deeply engrained life-long negative behavior pattern of yelling to get his way (though never at her before), was becoming intermittently distorted with the onset of dementia, namely--Alzheimer's. Marcell points out that not everyone becomes aggressive with dementia, and that her mother was sweet and lovely before and after her Alzheimer's diagnosis. </p><p> Statistically families (and doctors who are not dementia specialists) ignore early warning signs because they incorrectly believe that intermittently odd behaviors are just stress and a normal part of aging. Marcell says, "By the age of 65, one out of every eight has some form of dementia, and by the age of 85, nearly one out of every two. Surprisingly, the fastest growing segment of our population is the 85+ group." </p><p> Marcell says her mission is to "spread the word about the importance of early diagnosis of Alzheimer's to 77 million baby boomers who are in denial until a crisis." She wants everyone to know that with proper treatment, dementia symptoms can be masked/slowed, keeping the person independent longer. "Seeking help early can save families so much heartache and money, and save our society the burden of caring for so many who decline sooner than need be." </p><p> The Alzheimer's Association reports that by delaying the onset of A.D. for five years, the U.S. could save $50 billion in annual health care costs. Even a one-month delay in nursing home placement could save $1 billion a year. Marcell says, "It's really very simple: When your loved one does something that strikes you as illogical or irrational--it is! You don't need to have a Doctorate degree to know something is wrong--you need the right Doctor who can diagnose and treat dementia properly." </p><p> Marcell credits the Alzheimer's Association for referring her to a neurologist specialized in dementia who after a battery of tests uncovered her father's early stage Alzheimer's, while all of his other healthcare professionals missed it entirely. He prescribed medication to slow the dementia and improve her father's cognitive functioning (Aricept, Exelon, Razadyne, Namenda), and treated the aggression and (often-present) depression. After balancing with optimal nutrition and therapies, Marcell implemented her own `Elder Behavior Modification 101', and succeeded in turning around her father's nasty behaviors the majority of the time. And when that didn't work she used distraction, redirection, reminiscence and validation... but discovered the offer of his favorite ice cream worked the best to get him in the shower--even as he swore a blue streak at her that he had just taken one yesterday (actually a week ago). </p><p> The final key was getting herself into a support group and getting her parents out of bed ("waiting to die") and enrolled in physical and emotional therapies at an Adult Day Health Care, which completely turned their lives around at 80 and 85. Marcell adds, "75% of dementia patients are cared for at home and sadly elder abuse is rising dramatically because families are unprepared for the frustrations.

In&nbsp;<em>Messing with the Enemy,</em>&nbsp;the counterterrorism, cybersecurity and homeland security expert introduces us to a frightening world in which terrorists and cyber criminals don&#x2019;t hack your computer, they hack your mind. Watts reveals how these malefactors use your social media information and that of your family, friends and colleagues to map your social networks, identify your vulnerabilities, master your fears and harness your preferences.</p><p>Thanks to the schemes engineered by social media manipulators using you and your information, business executives have coughed up millions in fraudulent wire transfers, seemingly good kids have joined the Islamic State, and staunch anti-communist Reagan Republicans have cheered the Russian government&#x2019;s hacking of a Democratic presidential candidate&#x2019;s e-mails. Watts knows how they do it because he&#x2019;s mirrored their methods to understand their intentions, combat their actions, and coopt their efforts.</p><p>Watts examines a range of social media platforms&#x2014;from the first Internet forums to the current titans of Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn&#x2014;and nefarious actors&#x2014;from al Qaeda to the Islamic State to the Russian social media troll farm&#x2014;to illuminate exactly how they use Western social media for their nefarious purposes. He explains how he&#x2019;s learned, through his successes and his failures, to engage with hackers, terrorists, and even the Russians&#x2014;and how these interactions have generated methods for fighting back against those that seek to harm people on the Internet. He concludes with a snapshot of how advances in artificial intelligence will make future influence even more effective and dangerous to social media users and democratic governments worldwide.

Fisch, Professor of Art Emerita at San Diego State University, is an artist and jeweler working primarily in precious metals. She exhibits work nationally and internationally. Her work melds jewelry, sculpture, and clothing, and she incorporates the structure of textiles and fiber craft into metal-based pieces that are often inspired by ancient cultures and the natural world. Fisch is the recipient of numerous honors, including an honorary doctorate from Skidmore; a gold medal from the American Craft Council; the Lifetime Achievement Award in Crafts from the National Museum of Women in the Arts; and multiple Fulbright fellowships. Her work is represented in numerous museum and private collections.Weaving and knitting may not seem to be likely techniques for metalworkers, but fine wire and strips of metal can be made pliable enough to be worked this way. Fisch gives detailed instructions for metal weaving, knitting, crocheting, braiding, lacemaking, and basketry.

Part poetry, part paradox, always stirring and profound, the text has been inspiring readers since it was written over two thousand years ago. This extraordinary masterpiece is also one of the most frequently translated books in all of history, in part because it is simply impossible to translate into a Western language in a strictly literal way; there are just too many Chinese characters in the text that convey multiple meanings. This leads many translators to burden the text by having their translation explain too much, thereby losing the clarity of terse poetry that is so often found in the original. <br><br>The extraordinary strength of Sam Hamill's translation is that he has captured the poetry of Lao Tzu's original without sacrificing the resonance of the text's many meanings and possible interpretations. The result is a beautiful and deeply meditative rendering, one that is a delight to read over and over again. Accompanying Sam Hamill's translation are eighteen original calligraphies by one of the great masters of the art form, Kazuaki Tanahashi. Each calligraphy is of one Chinese word or character from the text itself, presented facing its appearance in the translation. Hamill then, in a caption to the calligraphy, offers just some of the many ways in which the Chinese character could be translated into English, giving the reader a fuller sense of the amazing richness of the original text and some idea as to the process of translation itself.</p><p>Not much is known about the legendary Lao Tzu, to whom authorship of the <i>Tao Te Ching </i> is popularly attributed. Some scholars believe the author was an elder contemporary of Confucius."Sam Hamill's new translation of the <i>Tao Te Ching </i> is what one could hope a new version&#x2014;a poet's version&#x2014;of this indispensable and incomparable text might be, but would hardly dare hope for. It is a kind of revelation of a heretofore-unknown aspect of the original and of its poetry, something that had not quite existed before in English. It brings us a fresh sense of the text, a new way of hearing it and intuiting it based on Hamill's years of study of the original Chinese words and careful listening to them. His grasp of these words has been guided also by many years of Zen practice, one of the ancestral sources of which is the <i>Tao Te Ching </i> itself. This is a version of rare lucidity and beauty, bringing the <i>Tao Te Ching </i> surprisingly close to us, at once intimate and intangible, and reminding us that it is, from the beginning, poetry." &#x2014;W. S. Merwin <br><br>"At a time when it is hard to know what to believe and whom, Sam Hamill's translation of the <i>Tao Te Ching </i> offers us spare beauty on the page, reminding us not only what is possible, but necessary. Wise and at times puzzling, this bare-boned translation of one of the world's most sacred texts is both poetry and prophecy."&#x2014;Terry Tempest Williams <br><br>"Sam Hamill has reached the category of a National Treasure, though I doubt he'd like the idea."&#x2014;Jim Harrison</p><h2>Freud: A life for our times</h2><p>Freud: A Life for Our Time is a biography about Freud written by Peter Gay. This is the original publication from 1988. The chapters of the book starts with Foundations 1856-1905 (A Greed for Knowledge, The Theory in the Making, and Psychoanalysis); then comes Elaborations 1902-1915 (Sketch of an Embattled Founder, Psychoanalytic Politics, Therapy and Technique, and Applications and Implications) and ends with Revisions 1915-1939 (Aggressions, Death Against Life, Flickering Lights on Dark Continents, Human Nature at Work, and To Die in Freedom). The Chicago Tribune wrote, &#34;[This] remarkable biography... briskly traces the story of Freud&#39;s life and education, deftly weaving the familiar narrative with a style that makes it seem fresh and lively.&#34; The ISBN # is 0-393-02517-9. The book contains 810 pages.</p><p>Gay's engrossing portrait of Freud is unconventional, at times startling. We see how a doting, domineering mother equipped young Sigmund for a life of intrepid investigation. We follow the ambitious medical student's long, sexually starved courtship of Martha Bernays, a romance that, according to Gay, influenced his theories about the sexual roots of mental ailments. Freud continually analyzed his own unresolved conflicts, blaming his fainting spells on unconscious homosexual urges. Though he preached that the psychoanalyst should be detached during therapy sessions, he bent and even broke his own rules, returning fees to patients who fell on hard times and making friends with his favorite analysands. Perhaps no biographer has succeeded as well as Gay in linking Freud's life to his writings and his times. In this magisterial biography by the eminent cultural historian (The Bourgeois Experience, etc.), Freud's greatness and his flaws flow out of the same stubborn, obsessive quest for truth. Photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.This simply wonderful book will take its place among the definitive biographies of Freud. The author, an historian and superb writer with psychoanalytical training, has written extensively on Freud and the era in which he worked. While clearly partial to Freud, Gay gives a far more balanced and at times critical account of his life than Ernest Jones's very orthodox The Life &amp; Work of Sigmund Freud and hence will provide a far more valuable refutation of works hostile to Freud. Outstanding features include the in-depth, lucid discussion of Freud's major works and masterful evocation of the epoch that ended in the terror of Nazi-occupied Vienna. Accessible and entertaining as well as comprehensive and technically rigorous; a great addition to the field.

He is an honorary life member of the U.S. Army Otter &amp; Caribou Association, the U.S. Army Special Forces Association, the U.S. Marine Corps Raider Association, and the USMC Combat Correspondents Association.This latest volume in the Corps series takes the U.S. Marines from Midway to Guadalcanal. Navy Cpt. Fleming Pickering travels to various headquarters, reporting events to the secretary of the Navy; recently promoted Cpt. Charley Galloway forms a new fighter squadron; Sgt. John Moore is a Japanese-language expert on a top-secret intelligence assignment. Griffin ( Counterattack ) employs a surprisingly effective alternative to military fiction's usual foxhole-and-cockpit perspective--he places the characters on the fringes rather than in the thick of the action, skirting familiar events and offering opportunities to explore the Pacific War's less familiar byways. As he creates a framework of coherent subplots and interesting personalities, he reveals WW II arcana, including the principles for establishing travel priorities and the status of enlisted Marine pilots. Sure to be welcomed by series fans, Battleground is also likely to inspire new readers to seek its predecessors. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Mystery of the Fiery Eye (Three Investigators Classics, Book 7)</h2><p>The Three Investigators must solve an old man&#39;s riddle to uncover a great fortune for their friend, Gus.

(Time)</p><h2>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885) (The Oxford Mark Twain)</h2><p>Called "the veriest trash" by a member of the Concord, Massachusetts Library Board that banned the novel when it was first published, <em>Huckleberry Finn</em> has come to be viewed, as H.L. Mencken put it, as "one of the great masterpieces of the world." Ernest Hemingway wrote that "All modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called <em>Huckleberry Finn</em>.... There was nothing before. There has been nothing as good since." As Toni Morrison notes in her introduction, "some of the stillness, in the beautifully rendered eloquence of a child, is breathtaking." Equally stunning is Twain's satirical critique of the hypocrisies and pretensions of adults. A daringly ironic attack on racism American-style, Twain's story of what he once called a "sound heart" triumphing over a "deformed conscience" is poignant, powerful, and fresh. It is no wonder that this extraordinary book continues to captivate readers around the world.</p><p>A seminal work of American Literature that still commands deep praise and still elicits controversy, <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> is essential to the understanding of the American soul. The recent discovery of the first half of Twain's manuscript, long thought lost, made front-page news. And this unprecedented edition, which contains for the first time omitted episodes and other variations present in the first half of the handwritten manuscript, as well as facsimile reproductions of thirty manuscript pages, is indispensable to a full understanding of the novel. The changes, deletions, and additions made in the first half of the manuscript indicate that Mark Twain frequently checked his impulse to write an even darker, more confrontational book than the one he finally published.Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

A man shoots a woman execution-style on a crowded sidewalk, then turns the gun on himself.<b><br><br></b>Even with Decker's extraordinary powers of observation and deduction, the killing is baffling. Decker and his team can find absolutely no connection between the shooter -- a family man with a successful consulting business -- and his victim, a schoolteacher. Nor is there a hint of any possible motive for the attack.<b><br><br></b>Enter Harper Brown. An agent of the Defense Intelligence Agency, she orders Decker to back off the case. The murder is part of an open DIA investigation, one so classified that Decker and his team aren't cleared for it.<b><br><br></b>But they learn that the DIA believes solving the murder is now a matter of urgent national security. Critical information may have been leaked to a hostile government -- or worse, an international terrorist group -- and an attack may be imminent.<br><br>Decker's never been one to follow the rules, especially with the stakes so high. Forced into an uneasy alliance with Agent Brown, Decker remains laser focused on only one goal: solving the case before it's too late.<br><b></b></p><p>David Baldacci is a global #1 bestselling author, and one of the world&#39;s favorite storytellers.

Kahn: In the Realm of Architecture: Condensed</h2><p>This condensed edition of<i> Louis I. Kahn: In the Realm of Architecture</i> is a definitive and richly illustrated volume that presents the oeuvre of one of this century's most influential practitioners, teachers, and thinkers in architecture. Here is the detailed account of the architecture and philosophy of Louis Kahn, whose buildings have become the very signature of the modernist aesthetic and whose vision permanently changed the direction of American architecture.<br><br>Kahn's career is documented here with meticulous attention to all aspects of his work-- from his own fascinating biography to the unique philosophy that underlies his buildings to the structures themselves. The stunning range of Kahn's architectural vision becomes fully apparent: his structures are at once solemn and resonant, elemental and musical. Extraordinary, exclusively commissioned color photographs of his masterworks-- the Yale Center for British Art, the National Assembly complex at Dhaka, Bangladesh, the Kimbell Art Museum, the Indian Institute of Management, the Salk Institute-- exquisitely demonstrate how Kahn's architecture wholly reinvents space and light. In all, more than two hundred illustrations, including numerous drawings and floor plans, accompany the painstakingly researched text.<br><br>This volume-- published in association with the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles and with the exclusive participation of the Louis I. Kahn Collection-- contains six principal essays that critically address different dimensions and periods of Kahn's architecture. The essays and photography are accompanied by succinct notes and captions, as well as a complete list of buildings and projects and an index, making this book the preeminent scholarly and illustrative source for Kahn's architecture.<br></p><p>A &#34;condensed edition&#34; of this book was published by Universe/Rizzoli in 1997.

(He had a very big bed.) <i>Confessions of a Late Night Talk Show Host</i> is a Hollywood autobiography like no other because it reveals all -- the loves and losses, the pain and joy, the shrinks and doctors -- and it is uproariously funny. Larry Sanders has written a book that will have the same ten-year run that his show did. </p><p> Larry Sanders is no ordinary man, and this book will show America and the world how very different he is. Fueled by an enormous need to be loved and gifted with a talent beyond even his own, Sanders has risen to the top of his field -- and dropped -- while retaining all of his dignity and modesty. As he says on the first page of his story, "I'm famous. Actually, I'm very, very, very famous." Sanders's story is laced with the names (and some of the faces) of the thousands of celebrities who have sought his attention for a decade -- and Sanders tells the world what he thinks of all of them, even if it hurts his own feelings. </p><p> <i>Confessions of a Late Night Talk Show Host</i> is a Hollywood tell-all that will forever change the nature of this kind of book. While Geraldo Rivera used his sexual exploits to shamelessly promote his book, Sanders uses his conquests of thousands of women to illustrate his compassion and grace. "If it sells, it sells," Sanders says. "There was never a hidden agenda." While Roseanne used her book to promote her many personalities, Sanders's book shows how a straight-shooter can not only survive but thrive in Hollywood. Most of all, Sanders, in truthfully disclosing all aspects of his life and those of people he has never met, hopes to heal and entertain. Sanders has written a wonderfully hilarious book that will make some of his fans wish he were back.</p></p><p>If you're a devoted fan of <i>The Larry Sanders Show</i>--the HBO program that wrapped up its award-filled run in May 1998--you've already got a copy. However, it was nice to find that this book, written by Sanders's comic alter ego Garry Shandling (assisted by the �ber-ghostwriter David Rensin), stands on its own as an ironic, tongue-deeply-in-cheek look at talk-showdom. Here are a few samples:<p> </p><blockquote>Here is a photo of Jennie Garth from <i>Beverly Hill 90210</i>. I had sex with her a dozen times, but she never reciprocated. Her excuse was, "I like men."</blockquote><p> </p><blockquote>Unbeknownst to most everyone except those of you who regularly read those trashy tabloids--and that would be all of you--I have suffered through many personal tragedies: an unhappy and abusive childhood, two divorces, many empty love affairs, a venereal disease that nearly took my right leg, feuds, substance dependencies, a palimony suit from my mother, who said, "You live with me for twenty years and move out just like that? This will cost you," and worst of all, the horror of being rear-ended backstage by one of Siegfried and Roy's big white leopards.</blockquote><p> <i>Confessions of a Late Night Talk Show Host</i> is an enjoyable tour through stardom with a truly sleazy Hollywood character. Anybody who relishes celebrity bios will get the joke and engage in delicious snickers of recognition.

What is the voyeuristic impulse behind our attraction to the gruesome and the horrible? Where does the magnetic appeal of the sordid and the scandalous come from? Is ugliness also in the eye of the beholder? Eco&#x2019;s encyclopedic knowledge and captivating storytelling skills combine in this ingenious study of the Ugly, revealing that what we often shield ourselves from and shun in everyday life is what we&#x2019;re most attracted to subliminally. Topics range from Milton&#x2019;s Satan to Goethe&#x2019;s Mephistopheles; from witchcraft and medieval torture tactics to martyrs, hermits, and penitents; from lunar births and disemboweled corpses to mythic monsters and sideshow freaks; and from Decadentism and picturesque ugliness to the tacky, kitsch, and camp, and the aesthetics of excess and vice. With abundant examples of painting and sculpture ranging from ancient Greek amphorae to Bosch, Brueghel, and Goya among others, and with quotations from the most celebrated writers and philosophers of each age, this provocative discussion explores in-depth the concepts of evil, depravity, and darkness in art and literature.</p><p><b>Umberto Eco</b> is a world-renowned writer of fiction, essays, and academic treatises and is undoubtedly one of the finest authors of our time. Among his best-selling novels are <i>The Name of the Rose</i>, <i>Foucault&#x2019;s Pendulum</i>, <i>The Island of the Day Before</i>, and <i>Baudolino</i>.INTRODUCTION <p>In every century, philosophers and artists have supplied definitions of beauty, and thanks to their works it is possible to reconstruct a history of aesthetic ideas over time. But this did not happen with ugliness. Most of the time it was defined as the opposite of beauty but almost no one ever devoted a treatise of any length to ugliness, which was relegated to passing mentions in marginal works. Hence, while a history of beauty can draw on a wide range of theoretical sources (from which we can deduce the tastes of a given epoch), for the most part a history of ugliness must seek out its own documents in the visual or verbal portrayals of things or people that are in some way seen as "ugly." Nonetheless, a history of ugliness shares some common characteristics with a history of beauty. First, we can only assume that the tastes of ordinary people corresponded in some way with the tastes of the artists of their day. If a visitor from space went into a gallery of contemporary art, and if he saw women's faces painted by Picasso and heard onlookers describing them as "beautiful," he might get the mistaken idea that in everyday life the men of our time find female creatures with faces like those painted by Picasso beautiful and desirable. But our visitor from space might modify his opinion on watching a fashion show or the Miss Universe contest, in which he would witness the celebration of other models of so-called called primitive peoples we have artistic finds but we have no theoretical texts to tell us if these were intended to cause aesthetic delight, holy fear, or hilarity. To a westerner an African ritual mask might seem hair-raising -- while for a native it might represent a benevolent divinity. Conversely, believers in some non-European religion might be disgusted by the image of Christ scourged, bleeding, and humiliated, while this apparent corporeal ugliness might arouse sympathy and emotion in a Christian. In the case of other cultures, with a wealth of poetic and philosophical texts (such as Indian, Chinese, or Japanese culture), we see images and forms but, on translating their works of literature and philosophy, it is almost always difficult to establish to what extent certain concepts can be identified with our own, although tradition has induced us to translate them into western terms such as "beautiful" or "ugly." Even if the translations were reliable, it would not be enough to know that in a certain culture something that possesses, for example, proportion and harmony, was seen as beautiful. Proportion and harmony. What do we mean by these terms? Even in the course of western history their meaning has changed. It is only by comparing theoretical statements with a picture or an architectonic structure from the period that we notice that what was considered proportionate in one century was no longer seen as such in another; on the subject of proportion, for example, a medieval philosopher would think of the dimensions and the form of a Gothic cathedral, while a Renaissance theoretician would think of a sixteenth-century temple, whose parts were governed by the golden section -- and Renaissance man saw the proportions of cathedrals as barbarous, as the term "Gothic" amply suggests. Concepts of beauty and ugliness are relative to various historical periods or various cultures and, to quote Xenophanes of Colophon (according to Clement of Alexandria, Stromata, V, 110), "But had the oxen or the lions hands, or could with hands depict a work like men, were beasts to draw the semblance of the gods, the horses would them like to horses sketch, to oxen, oxen, and their bodies make of such a shape as to themselves belongs."</p></p><h2>Love Alone: Eighteen Elegies for Rog</h2><p>An eighteen-poem cycle on the death of his lover from AIDS emphasizes the power of love and its survival through pain and anger, and the tragedy and magnitude of a terrifying twist of fate and its effect on a generation</p><p>Monette, best known for his light novels and movie novelizations, is also a gifted poet who has published intermittently since 1971. His third book of poems is occasioned by the death of his lover, Roger Horwitz, of AIDS in 1986. Written "for those who are mad with loss," it stands apart from its predecessors, and indeed from most contemporary poetry, in both intent and execution. The poems use remembered episodes to celebrate "that two men ceased to be single," but more often ride express the rage felt during Rog's dying and the ache of being the remaining half of a couple. Though I do not share his worship of The Gay Couple, and in fact find it irritating, this book will be a balm for those who see AIDS primarily as a deadly assault on an already besieged army of lovers.

They did not know exactly why God had brought them there, what He wanted them to do, or even where the money to live on would come from. But He began opening doors, and people with questions about life's meaning began finding the way to their home.</p> <p>Edith Schaeffer, wife of Dr. Francis Schaeffer, tells the remarkable story of how God led them step by step, as that one small chalet grew into a whole community. It took the name L'Abri (French for shelter). Day by day, God faithfully provided for their family, and eventually for the entire community.</p> <p>The Schaeffers believed that truth must be demonstrated as well as debated. They wanted to show the world through the transformed lifestyle of a believing community that the personal-infinite God is really here in our generation. In a society losing the ability to distinguish between Christian and non-Christian values, truth and untruth, good and evil, L'Abri equipped people to make that distinction.</p> <p>For more than thirty years, people have come to L'Abri from all walks of life and from many countries, searching for truth and reality. There they find someone who cares for them personally, who listens carefully to their questions, and who gives them answers based on an uncompromising commitment to Biblical truth. L'Abri now has branches in several other countries and has affected the lives of literally thousands of people around the world.</p></p><p><p><strong>EDITH SCHAEFFER </strong>is the widow of Francis Schaeffer, and with him co-founder of L'Abri Fellowship.

Alone for the first time in his life, Harry felt the loss acutely and terribly, and for a long while, despite continued good health, he was uncertain about whether he could go on without Ruby. It was then that he turned to the past for solace&#x2013;and ended up fulfilling a lifelong dream of becoming a published author.<br><br>Delightful and hopeful, tender and moving, The Golden Willow is Harry&#x2019;s tribute to his beloved Ruby, to their long, happy life together, to the impact her parting had on his heart and his soul, and to the surprises and unexpected pleasures that continue to await him.</p><p>Ninety-nine-year-old Harry Bernstein immigrated to the United States with his family after World War I.

Bernstein lives in Brick, New Jersey, where he is working on another book.<i>Chapter One<br>2000</i><br><br>On the morning of my ninetieth birthday I awoke very early and to a rather strange experience. The moment I opened my eyes I was blinded by a curtain of dancing, dazzling spots of light of different colors and shapes. They sometimes merged into one another, forming new shapes and sizes and colors, and never remained still. It was like looking through a kaleidoscope, and not at all unpleasant, and so I remained still for a while, looking into this magic, surrounded by a deep silence that was broken only by the sound of birds singing outside in the garden.<br><br>And as I did so, a curious thought ran through my head: that this was how the world was at the very beginning, before people came, just these colors and this deep silence, and nothing else.<br><br>Then I shifted my head slightly on the pillow, and the phenomenon vanished instantly. It was, after all, only the sun bursting through the window and stabbing right into my eyes. I could now lie with everything quite normal, and I was careful not to shift about too much lest I disturb my wife, who was sleeping quietly at my side, her still-dark hair tumbled about her head on the pillow, her breathing light and barely audible.<br><br>I lay there listening to the sound of the birds singing outside, one bird seeming to dominate all the others with its sweet, trilling notes-a mockingbird, I have no doubt. It was altogether a pleasant spring day, and I could not have wanted anything better for my birthday. Yet as my thoughts came awake, I was conscious of a certain heaviness growing inside me.<br><br>I was suddenly becoming aware of the fact that I was ninety years old that day, and that in turn gave my mind a morbid twist, for ninety was old, it was very old. At one time I would have considered anyone of that age as good as dead. Certainly it was the end of things. And what had I done in all those years to justify my existence? I had wanted to be a writer. But the best I had done so far were some short stories published in little magazines that few people read, some freelance writing for newspaper Sunday supplement magazines, and a short novel published by a small press that nobody had read except myself and the publisher, who went bankrupt right after he published my book. True, I had written dozens of other novels, but none of them had ever been published.<br><br>I thought of all that as I lay there that morning, and gloom swept over me. It was too late now. I could never be the writer I had wanted to be. There was nothing really to celebrate about this birthday.<br><br>Then I heard a faint stirring at my side. I turned my head a little. It was my wife. She was still sleeping, but was evidently in the process of beginning to awaken. As I looked at her and listened to her quiet breathing, I thought, Well, here's some compensation for all the things I haven't done. I had married her in 1935, during the Depression, and I'd had a wonderful life with her.<br><br>I remembered something of those early days, and a smile came to my face. Our first home was a furnished room in a brownstone on West 68th Street, and it was there one day, while we were still in the passionate throes of our honeymoon, that I led Ruby to the mirror that hung over the dresser.<br><br>I told her to look into it, and I stepped behind her, took both her cheeks between my fingers, and pulled, distorting the lovely features.<br><br>"When you are older, maybe sixty or seventy"-who could get older than that?-"you may look like this," I said, "but I'll love you as much then as I do now."<br><br>Well, I had kept my promise: I did love her as much now as I had then. But she never looked the way I had predicted. In my eyes, she was as beautiful now as the day I had met her, at a dance in Webster Hall in New York. She was only a year younger than I, and yet her features showed only the slightest wrinkling, and her hair was still mostly dark, with only a few touches of gray here and there.<br><br>Then I realized that she was awake and was looking up at me with her large, dark eyes, and she was smiling.<br><br>"Happy birthday, darling," she whispered, and I bent and kissed her.<br><br>Yes, I had a lot to be thankful for, and it took some of the gloom away. Besides, it was truly a lovely day, just perfect for a celebration, bright and sunny and gently warm. And at this time of the year the retirement community in New Jersey in which we lived was at its best, the streets decorated with rows of ornamental trees in full bloom, row after row of dazzling white blossoms. The flowers were out everywhere, the tulips, the daffodils, the irises, and wherever you went, you caught the rich fragrance of lilacs.<br><br>Our garden was at its best too, with our cherry tree a mass of pink, the dogwood delicately white, and the mock orange pure white also and giving off its orange-like fragrance so deep and rich it made you hold your breath. But it was our golden willow that held your attention, giant in the center of the garden with its long, thin branches billowing out into the shape of an old-fashioned ball gown, with some of the branches trailing along the ground gracefully.<br><br>The golden willow was the first tree we had planted when we came here to live, and Ruby and I had good reason for doing that, only it was a secret that we kept to ourselves. A mere thin sapling when we put it in the ground, it had grown to a tremendous size, outstripping all the other trees in the garden, standing big and beautiful in the center of them all, a shining gold centerpiece. It attracted immediate attention as we led our guests out onto the lawn that day to loll in the sun on the lawn chairs we'd set out and to sip drinks before dinner.<br><br>When our grandchildren were younger, they used to play hide-and-seek in the willow tree, and Ruby and I, watching them, would cast amused glances at each other, knowing well the hiding places in that tree. It was part of our secret. But the grandchildren were older now, too old to play, old enough to be able to join us for drinks.<br><br>Well, everybody was older that day, and there were fewer guests than there had been at previous birthdays. They had been dwindling for several years now, our relatives and friends dropping off one by one. Our son, Charles, and his wife were there with their adult children, as were our daughter, Adraenne, and her husband, and two or three still surviving friends, a relatively small number compared to what there used to be at previous gatherings.<br><br>Dinner was held as usual at the Harvest, a favorite restaurant of ours, and the Polish proprietress, a tall, thin, bony woman with a pronounced accent, whom we knew well from years of dining there, had insisted on making it a special early Thanksgiving dinner, complete with turkey and all the trimmings.<br><br>"For you," she had said to me when we were ordering the dinner, "it must be a Thanksgiving party. You are ninety. Not many people come to be ninety. So we give thanks to God."<br><br>It was an extraordinarily good dinner, a regular feast, and jolly enough, but not as jolly as previous birthday parties, and I missed two of our good friends who had died the past year, Ann and Pete Warth, with whom we had gone to Europe once, and whom we'd seen almost every day-both of them in that same year gone. And another was my younger brother, Sidney. All my other brothers and sisters had died in the past few years, and I had fully expected that Sidney, who was ten years younger than I, would outlive me. But no, he too had gone, and I was the only one left in my family.<br><br>I thought of that in the midst of all the jollity at the dinner table, and I felt a heaviness inside me, but was careful not to show it to Ruby or any of our guests.<br><br>The highlight of the party came with their serving of the birthday cake. The proprietress herself carried the cake in, leading a procession of waiters all singing "Happy Birthday." She placed it in front of me, while those at our table and the other tables around us all cheered. There were nine tall candles burning in the top of the mountainous multilayered cake, each one representing a decade, and I was to blow them out-if possible, in one breath. That was my intention, and it would show them that I still had strength enough to do the job. I bent down over the cake and blew as hard as I could, but all that happened was that the flames on the candles flickered to one side but remained lit. I blew again, and the same thing happened. There were encouraging shouts, and I tried but failed once more. Amidst all the shouting and laughter, one of my younger grandchildren, Pete, slipped over to my side, saying, "Let me help you, Grandpa."<br><br>He bent down beside me, pursed his lips, and blew, and all the candles went out. Cheers went up, and more laughter, and I had to laugh with them. I thanked Pete, hiding the mortification I felt, and cut the first slice of cake. I tried to forget what had happened. But it was the first time in all my birthdays that I had failed to blow out the candles on a birthday cake, and it hurt.<br><br>We saw our guests off that evening. It had grown dark by then, but it was still early. We stood outside and waved to them as they drove off in their cars. Then we started to turn to go back into the house, but stopped. It was a lovely evening and there was a full moon out, big and bright in a sky filled with stars. I think it reminded us of something, another evening like that. But neither of us said anything about that.<br><br>"Would you like to go for a walk?" I asked.<br><br>"Yes." Ruby spoke instantly. She loved walking, as I did, especially on evenings like this when it was just too pleasant to be indoors. The weather, in fact, seemed to have grown warmer, and it was almost a summery warmth, so there'd be no need for me to go in and get her a wrap of some sort against any evening coolness.<br><br>Ordinarily, a walk would have meant going around the lake, which was at the foot of our street and had a path that was a little more than a mile in circumference, just long enough for an evening stroll. But instead of turning to the right toward the lake<br><br>I turned in the opposite direction and led her with me. She was puzzled.<br><br>"Where are we going?" she said.<br><br>"You'll see," I said.<br><br>It wasn't far. I led her to our garden at the back of the house, and there was the golden willow I had brought her to see, shining and more beautiful than ever in the moonlight, as I had expected it would be. And more than that: It was a duplicate of the one we had seen in Central Park so many years ago, which had inspired us to plant this one.<br><br>The feeling for that night was strong in me. It had been a long time ago, before Ruby and I were married. It was the summer we had met one hot night at a dance. I had no job then, and no money, so I couldn't take her to theaters or places where it cost money, and Central Park was free. Ruby didn't care so long as we were together, and she went with me gladly to the park almost every night. There were band concerts on some days, and outdoor dancing on others, and there was always the zoo, and perhaps best of all, the benches hidden in the shadow of trees.<br><br>That night we had gone to the band concert, and we sat listening for a while, then became restless. It was a night like tonight, a full moon in the sky, stars everywhere, and we slipped away and began strolling hand in hand along the path that borders the lake there, pausing now and then to kiss. Suddenly, we saw it from a distance, towering over all the other trees, its golden leaves shining in the moonlight. We had never seen one before, and its beauty took our breath away. We went up to it and stood looking at it closely for a while, then I parted some of the branches and we stepped inside. It was like entering some holy place. It made me think of a cathedral, with its high ceiling formed around the thick trunk. Ruby and I stood looking at each other in the dark, and then I put my arms around her and drew her to me, and then we were lying on a bed of soft, rotted branches that had formed around the base of the tree over the years, and we could hear the band playing in the distance, and it was there we had our first lovemaking.<br><br>Well, it all came back to me as I stood looking at our willow bathed in the moonlight in our garden, and I suddenly found myself parting the branches of the tree with one hand while holding Ruby's hand with the other.<br><br>"What are we doing?" Ruby whispered, looking around, fearful that some of our neighbors might be watching.<br><br>I didn't answer. I knew what I was doing. I tried to lead her in. "Come on," I whispered back.<br><br>"Are you crazy?" she said.<br><br>"No, I'm not," I said. "Please come in with me."<br><br>"Do you realize," she said, "you're ninety years old?"<br><br>"Yes. That's why I want to go in."<br><br>She came with me into the tree. Perhaps I had been thinking also of trying and failing to blow out those candles on the birthday cake. Perhaps some of the sting had remained. But I think it was more than that. It was the moonlight too, and the recollection of that night in Central Park. Our bed was as soft as the one there. Many years of rotted branches and leaves had accumulated, and the loamy smell was strong in our nostrils. We slept afterward, close together, our arms wrapped around each other.</p><h2>Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos</h2><p>Printed in Asia - Carries Same Contents as of US edition - Opt Expedited Shipping for 3 to 4 day delivery -</p><p></p><h2>Create a Mediterranean Garden</h2><p>Create a Mediterranean Garden full of glorious color and scent, with vivid flowers and foliage, and aromatic herbs - the perfect outdoor living room.</p><p></p><h2>Barack Obama&#39;s Rules for Revolution: The Alinsky Model</h2><p>Vital information about how the radical left operates.

A treat for all ages, these picture stories unlock the enchanted door into the pleasures of books and reading!</p><p>Best Children's Books 2000 (PW)</p></p><p>These days, most comics really aren't for kids. But <i>Little Lit</i> fixes that with funny and fractured all-ages fairy tales by some of the best comic artists around. Annoying magic pumpkins, a horrible ogre queen, and strangely hungry horses are just some of the strange characters guaranteed to delight both children and adults.<p> Twelve great tales, some new and some retold classics, with weird and wacky pictures fill the pages of <i>Little Lit</i>. Comic fans will recognize the talents of Dan Clowes, Kaz, Joost Swarte, and many more. Kids will love the unexpected twists on old favorites, like the lions who populate Barbara McClintock's "The Princess and the Pea." Like all good fairy tales, many of these stories have lessons hidden in them. <i>Maus</i> creator Art Spiegelman tells the story of a young prince who finds out he doesn't have to change the thing he likes best about himself in "Prince Rooster." And Harry Bliss's "The Baker's Daughter" finds out the hard way that she shouldn't be stingy.</p><p> Walt Kelly's 1943 "The Gingerbread Man" gives today's kids a taste of the comic books of yesteryear. There are even activities, like Charles Burns's "Spookyland" and Bruce McCall's silly "What's Wrong with this Picture?"

Transcribed from tapes only recently discovered, <i>This Craft of Verse</i> captures the cadences, candor, wit, and remarkable erudition of one of the most extraordinary and enduring literary voices of the twentieth century. In its wide-ranging commentary and exquisite insights, the book stands as a deeply personal yet far-reaching introduction to the pleasures of the word, and as a first-hand testimony to the life of literature. </p><p> Though his avowed topic is poetry, Borges explores subjects ranging from prose forms (especially the novel), literary history, and translation theory to philosophical aspects of literature in particular and communication in general. Probably the best-read citizen of the globe in his day, he draws on a wealth of examples from literature in modern and medieval English, Spanish, French, Italian, German, Greek, Latin, Arabic, Hebrew, and Chinese, speaking with characteristic eloquence on Plato, the Norse kenningar, Byron, Poe, Chesterton, Joyce, and Frost, as well as on translations of Homer, the Bible, and the Rub�iy�t of Omar Khayy�m. </p><p> Whether discussing metaphor, epic poetry, the origins of verse, poetic meaning, or his own "poetic creed," Borges gives a performance as entertaining as it is intellectually engaging. A lesson in the love of literature and in the making of a unique literary sensibility, this is a sustained encounter with one of the writers by whom the twentieth century will be long remembered. </p></p><p>Jorge Luis Borges (1899-1986) is the author of <i>Labyrinths and Ficciones</i>, among other books. His <i>Collected Fictions</i> was recently published in a new translation.Borges started to make a living by lecturing after overcoming the shyness that made him stutter, marring his early years. Although he never lost entirely the fear of large audiences, he managed to make a master form out of the public lecture genre. Some of his best essays were first delivered as talks, mostly in the English tradition of confession, wit, and eloquence. This performance of intelligent intimacy with the audience gave his rich commentary and bright summation a conversational tone and the poignancy of a revelation. Borges had an epiphanic view of reading, and to him literature was a memory of the exceptional. These lectures have that elegance and edge, indeed the beauty of the best possible library on the happiest of islands.<br> --Julio Ortega, Brown University<br><br>In <i>fThis Craft of Verse</i>, [Borges] discusses some of his favorite texts, conducting a literary journey that began in his father's library in Buenos Aires...The unhurried flow and warmth of these talks produce a sense of intimacy, Borges's enjoyment infecting the audience...Borges's ultimate gift is his unwavering belief in the world of dreams and ideas, the sense that life is "made of poetry."<br> --Micaela Kramer (<i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>Jorge Luis Borges is inarguably the most influential Latin-American essayist and short-story writer of our time. To spend a few hours in [his] company, even on the page, is a civilized entertainment not to be missed...[Borges] emphasizes the power of poetry to work its magic...I would have given a lot to have been at Harvard in the audience when this courtly man of letters looked "upward with gentle and shy expression on his face, seeming to materially touch the world of the texts" and spoke about the poems and books he loved most.<br> --Michael Dirda (<i>Washington Post Book World</i>)<br><br>If few writers in history have been as prodigiously learned as Borges, certainly none wore their learning so lightly or humbly...[The lectures] display the eloquence and erudite, offhand wit familiar from his writings as well as a charming, plainspoken modesty. Ostensibly about poetics, the talks were an occasion for Borges to review his lifelong relationship with literature, including his passion for English. (<i>New Yorker</i> 2000-11-06)<br><br>Readers who fret they don't 'get' everything--'significant' readers with no allowance for sound, rhythm, revelation--would benefit from Jorge Luis Borges' [lectures]...Even in these scholarly lectures, given without notes...there is so much assumption and conjecture, there are so many gaps to fill, that Borges seems to be creating at once the authors and the ideas and the texts he's quoting...But there is also in <i>This Craft of Verse</i> the small pleasure of watching a wordsmith seek the joy of minutiae, the nitty-gritty of lex.<br> --Orlando Aloma (<i>Miami Herald</i> 2000-10-15)<br><br>These newly released transcripts display a literary giant, managing from beneath heavy academic robes to keep the spryness and serendipity of literature alive...Here Borges daydreams aloud, and the result is wonderfully disarming.<br> --Carlin Romano (<i>Boston Globe</i> 2000-11-06)<br><br>What's most astonishing about these previously uncollected essays...is that for all their complexity and elusiveness they are oral performances. While Borges's blindness is a major figure in his writing, the breadth and density of his rhetorical web obscures the fact that he has no notes to read, that he is calling these texts up from the inexhaustible abyss of his memory...In his decomposition of genres and styles, Borges provokes language to express this immanent word-magic, knitting his own pronouncements together with the primordial force of oral composition. Borges speaks on metaphor, bringing the tangled, sensuous allegories of San Juan de la Cruz into contact and concert with the cold, salty kennings of the Norse Eddas. He discusses translation with freshness and an uncanny sensitivity to the ligatures among the languages; he considers the narrative arc and the transformation of thought into poetry...As editor Calin-Andrei Mihailescu puts it in his graceful afterword to this volume, 'Literature,' for Borges, 'was a mode of experience.'<br> --Matthew Battles (<i>www.hermenaut.com</i>)<br><br>Few have dedicated themselves to literature with the purity of Jorge Luis Borges, so the discovery of the text of his Harvard University Norton Lectures for 1967-68, now published as <i>This Craft of Verse</i>, is cause for celebration. Common sense and radical insight flow in equal measure here: <i>This Craft of Verse</i> will inspire young and old alike to follow the muses.

Although Robb was a skilled carpenter, boatbuilding (and boat repair) required a specialized set of skills. And this wasn't just any boat; it was a Herreshoff 12 1/2, a classic wooden sailboat. Built especially for the coastal waters of New England, this little sloop had sailed for years out of the author's boyhood home in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, before being relegated to a quiet corner of a yard, no longer the focus of the family's summer. Restoring the sailboat was both an act of respect and an homage to a place and a way of life that are in jeopardy of disappearing.<br> <br><i>Sloop</i> is the captivating story of Daniel Robb's education in boatbuilding, peopled by an eccentric cast of characters&#x2014;lumbermen, boatbuilders, and local artisans&#x2014;who are part of a changing and perhaps dying world. They tell Robb how to find the materials&#x2014;certain kinds of wood, fastenings, caulking, and canvas&#x2014;he'll need, which are increasingly hard to come by, and they educate him in the techniques of restoration, an all-but-lost art. Building and restoring wooden boats means an initiation into a world where life is lived simply, with respect for materials, for labor, and for the local waters.<br> <br>A craftsman and environmentalist, Robb is a willing and able student, and although the restoration of the boat takes far more time and effort than he'd calculated, it is ultimately successful. After all Robb's struggles with quartersawn white oak, homemade steam boxes, bronze screws, copper rivets, andold mast hoops, the Herreshoff sails again&#x2014;and a dying art and a vanishing way of life remain alive and vibrant just a while longer.<br> <br>By turns charming, meditative, and wonderfully quirky, <i>Sloop</i> is a paean to a sense of place and to old-fashioned values.</p><p>Author of Crossing the Water, Daniel Robb has been an editor of academic journals, a teacher, a political consultant on a congressional campaign, and a proprietor of a literary services business. He has also worked at sea on schooners, taught sailing, and raced in national competitions. Robb lives in Pelham, Massachusetts.<b>11. Shed: Done</b><p>Continue with the shed I did, rolling into the lumberyard at 9 a.m. or so on Monday. Lenny was there at the gate. I lowered my window.</p><p>"Hey Lenny, what're you doing up so early?"</p><p>"Bah humbug," he said.</p><p>"Lenny," I said, "There's only a hundred and eighty-two shopping days til Christmas. You aware of that?"</p><p>"Not if they drop the bomb on us, guy," he said, smiling at me.</p><p>He had me there. All I could do was drive on. I bought three more bundles of twelve-foot strapping. I had a whole bundle to break and still have enough to make the struts. On the way out Lenny checked my receipt and made sure the punchout (a little paper silhouette of Batman, this time) fell on my lap.</p><p>"Thanks, Lenny," I said.</p><p>"Bah humbug," he said.</p><p>It was about 9:30 when I got back home and began the process of making struts, again, being careful to keep the strapping in the mild sun as I did this. I broke just one piece, and soon had the twelve struts I figured I'd need for the shed.</p><p>The next step was to cobble together a twenty-foot ridgepole, which I did by laying down two ten-foot pieces of old two-by-four, end to end, and scarfing them together with a couple of four-foot two-by-four cheeks. This made a twenty foot beam. Then I fished a couple of twelve-foot posts made up of doubled two-by-fours out of the lumber pile. I had used these in staging I'd built to shingle a house, and they had been lying around ever since. I stood these up plumb at either end of my rectangle of foundation timbers, and then held them there with a couple of two-by-four braces. This was rough carpentry at its finest.</p><p>Then I screwed the ridgepole to the upright posts, one end at a time, and I was ready to lay my prebent struts along the sides, bowed out, so they would come together along the ridge beam like the ribs of a whale along a backbone. Which I did, and screwed them on, and added horizontal bracing between the struts. Then I spread an old tarp folded long and thin along the top of the ridgepole to take care of rough edges that might puncture the plastic wrap, and I began to wrap the shed.</p><p>It took three passes, beginning at the bottom. Each layer was held on by a few staples, with the final pass draped over the ridge. Then I stapled two-inch-wide strips of old shingle onto the outside of the struts to hold the plastic securely.</p><p>And it held, and seemed to work. Time to get Bill over for a look.</p><p>Copyright � 2008 by Daniel Robb</p><p><b></b></p><b>12. Consultation</b><p>I called Bill as soon as I was done with the shed, which was at about four in the afternoon. He answered, sounding weary.</p><p>"Hello," he said.</p><p>"That Bill?" I asked.</p><p>"Yup," he said.</p><p>"Dan here. Wondering if I can get you over to look at this boat when you have a chance."</p><p>"How about now?" he asked.</p><p>"You sure?"</p><p>"I gotta get the heck out of here," he said. "I've been waiting for some epoxy to go off so I can get at it with a grinder and it ain't. Think I must have let the can freeze this winter. I dunno. But I've cut as many bungs as I can stand to cut while I wait."</p><p>"Well, now would be great," I said.</p><p>"I'll see you in a few," he said, and hung up.</p><p>That was remarkable. Although it is good, if you're a tradesman, to get out and look at somebody else's problems. I suppose it's good if you're anybody. Ten minutes later he was in the drive in his pickup, which was a Japanese two-wheel-drive manual shift with a logo on the door, "Mayhew Boatbuilders, Senegansett, MA," in narrow gold letters.</p><p>He strode up to the shed in the same clothes he'd been wearing the other day, produced an awl in his right hand, walked through the opening I'd left in the plastic, and jammed the spike into the bow of the boat.</p><p>"Stem's solid there," he said.</p><p>"No time for hand shaking, huh?" I said.</p><p>"Oh, sorry," he said, sticking out his hand, which I shook.</p><p>"Yeah, I needed to get out of the shop," he went on. "One of those days."</p><p>"Rafe driving you nuts?"</p><p>"No, not today. He's out on his own today, checking out a double-ender a guy in Woods Hole wants us to cold-mold for him."</p><p>He was referring here to a practice where one takes an older wooden boat, shores up the hull, and then encases it in two or more layers of thin strips of wood, the second layer running in direction counter to the first, with epoxy gluing it all together. This wood-epoxy shell is then finished off with gelcoat, which results in a wooden boat which feels like wood and looks like wood (on the inside, anyway) but which looks and acts like fiberglass on the outside. The hull is suddenly immaculate, maintenance free, and leak free. It also becomes a much stronger boat, all for the addition of a shell around the hull a half an inch thick.</p><p>"I didn't know you guys did a lot of that," I said.</p><p>"We don't do it much, but it isn't real hard, and it does seem to be a good way to go."</p><p>"What do you think of working with the glue?" I asked.</p><p>"It's not so bad, but talk to me in thirty years when I've grown my second head, then I'll tell you what I think," he said. "Both of us will. So let's see what we got here."</p><p>He walked all the way around the boat, stopping here and there to look at details and to poke his awl into the hull.</p><p>"The planks go all the way fore and aft on this side," he said. "That's good. And the stem is fine," he said, poking again into the piece of oak that formed the leading edge of the bow. "The planks are continuous on this side, too," he went on, as he completed his circle around the boat. "Good."</p><p>"Everything's a little dry, but that's okay," he said, continuing to walk around the boat, "and the planks aren't pulling away from the frames much. This piece here is just filler," he said, poking at a two-foot chunk of oak at the forward end of the keel that was clearly gonzo.</p><p>"That can come right off. Cut a new one, screw it right back on there, and fair it out," he said. "No problem."</p><p>"The deadwood," he went on, poking at the big slabs of oak that made up the keel between the hollow part of the hull and the lead at the very bottom, "looks good, too. You know, Dan, I've seen a lot worse. But I can see that some of these planks are coming away from the frames [Bill, like many boatbuilders,calls ribs "frames"], so I think you have at the very least a complete reframing and refastening project on your hands."</p><p>As he said this he poked his nose over the gunwale, and looked down into the bilge.</p><p>"Oh Lordy yes, look at that. Those frames are just about to dry up and blow away." He went on, "I tell you what, man. You're going to need to replace most of those frames, which means taking off this cap rail." As he said this he tapped the thin piece of mahogany that formed the "rail" of the boat, the rim around the edge of the cockpit. "You gotta do that so you can get at the tops of the frames. You're also going to have to cut the rivets which hold the bottoms of the frames to the floor timbers, and split those frames right out of there."</p><p>The floor timbers were trapezoids of oak held perpendicular to the top of the keel by long bronze bolts. At intervals of every ten inches or so along the spine of the boat down in the bilge there was a floor timber. A frame was riveted to each end of each timber (one on either side), and the frames then rose in graceful curves up to the gunwales of the boat, with the planks screwed to the frames and running horizontally. It was a simple, strong way to build a boat (sometimes called "carvelbuilt") and as Bill assessed the boat's structure it lost some of its mystery, and with that its ability to intimidate me.</p><p>"How do I get at the floor timbers?" I asked.</p><p>"Well, if I were you," he said, standing quiet now in a mote of sun with his arms crossed, "I'd take off her two bottom planks on both sides. They're going to need refastening anyway, and once they're off, you'll be able to get right in there and see what you need to do."</p><p>I took this in, seeing that taking off the bottom two planks on each side would indeed make things vastly easier, allowing me to reach into the bilge (where all the action was) from the outside of <i>Daphie</i>. But it was also going to be weird, because once those four planks were off, the whole upper part of the boat would be supported only by the frames, without the skin of planks holding it together at the waist. This would be like seeing a person reduced to skeleton through the lower part of her abdomen, while she retained her torso and the rest of her body. But I would adjust to it. This was, after all, the only way to health for <i>Daphie</i>.</p><p>"One last question, Bill," I said. I actually had three.</p><p>"Yup," he said, and looked back at me with his eyes open wide.</p><p>"Would you replace the keel bolts?" This was a question I dreaded asking, as replacing the keel bolts could mean a huge investment of time: I would need to get new ones made, and then install them somehow under the floor timbers. The keel bolts held the heavy oak and lead keel to the rest of the boat, so they were critical components. As I asked this I had visions of lying crushed on the sand under the lead keel after it had fallen off the boat.</p><p>See, I knew that to replace the bolts I'd probably have to remove that lead keel (somehow) and then recast it, which would mean making a mold from the original, setting that mold into the sand on the beach, cutting up the old keel and then melting it in a kettle over a fire, pouring the old molten lead into the mold for the new keel, and hoping all went well. If I were still upright and breathing after that whole scenario, I'd still have to tap new holes for the new bolts in the new lead keel, and then reinstall the new 750-pound behemoth -- all of which process increased the possibility for disaster and mayhem.</p><p><i>River of Molten Lead Engulfs Coasta l Community: Amat eur Boat builder Imolated.</i></p><p>"No, I'd leave those bolts alone," he said. "You could take one out and have a look at it, but in my experience they're usually okay."</p><p>"Really?" I said.</p><p>"Yup."</p><p>Yahoo! This was hugely good news.</p><p>"What about the floor timbers?" I asked.</p><p>"They look okay," he said.</p><p>"Really?"

Discover the pipe?s true magic as our hero uses it to inspire and save the whole village. <p>Steven Kellogg?s clever new take on <i>The Pied Piper of Hamelin </i>is friendly, whimsical, and full of surprise.<br><br></p></p><p>I have loved picture books ever since I was a child. The illustrations of Beatrix Potter and N. C. Wyeth were early favorites, and I always found any kind of animal story irresistible. I was an enthusiastic young artist as well, and I formulated pre-school plans to make drawing the center of my lifetime career. I used to dream up stories and illustrate them for my younger sisters, Patti and Martha. We called the activity: "Telling Stories on Paper." When it took place, I would sit between them with a stack of paper on my lap and a pencil in my hand, rattling off tales and scribbling illustrations to accompany them, and passing the pictures first to one of the girls and then to the other. I enjoyed these storytelling sessions enormously and I usually persevered until my sisters were too restless to sit there any longer, or until they were buried under pieces ofpaper.<p>I scribbled my way through elementary, junior- and senior-high school, and afterward I attended the Rhode Island School of Design, where I majored in illustration, and where I was particularly intrigued by the few projects we were given that related to the creation of picture books. I wasfortunate enough to win a fellowship that made possible a senior year of work and study in Florence, Italy. It was an exciting and fulfilling period for me, and I find that I draw constantly on the experience and images that I stored during my time there.</p><p>Upon my return to the United States I did some graduate work and teaching at American University, and at the same time I began submitting picture book ideas to various publishers. Itwas an exciting moment when the first acceptances came in, and I realized that I would be able to "tell stories on paper" full-time and to a much larger audience. I loved the challenge of putting the first books together, guiding them through the various stages of the publishing process, and thenwatching them disperse into the lives of their readers. And now, twenty-five years and almost ninety books later, I still find every aspect of my involvement just as absorbing andenjoyable.</p><p>During the time that I've been working on the picture books, I've lived in an old farmhouse in the hills of Connecticut which I've shared with my wife, Helen, and where I've raised six stepchildren, to whom most of my books are dedicated. Also in residence have been numerous dogs and cats, including a beloved harlequin Great Dane named Pinkerton, whose stubborn inadaptability during puppyhood inspired the book <b>Pinkerton, Behave!</b> The heroine of the sequel, <b>ARose for Pinkerton</b>, was our senior cat, Secondhand Rose, an independent old grouch who was born a wild thing in the Catskill Mountains, and who devoted her long life to harassing everyone in the world, including Pinkerton.</p><p>The ideas for the other books come from lots of different sources, but most of them have their roots in feelings and images that I retain from my own childhood. I try to blend illustrations and the words so that each book is a feast for the eye and ear. I want the time that the reader shares with me and my work to be an enjoyable experience -- one that will encourage a lifetimeassociation with pictures, words, and books.</p><p><b>Steven Kellogg talks about the art of the picturebook</b>The picture book is an art form that is designed specifically for children, but I feel that it can be appreciated and enjoyed by all ages. For centuries a distinguished tradition of illustrated books and manuscripts has existed of which the picture book is a part. It is a synthesis of literature and the visual arts, and the relationship of the written word and the picture is its essence.I am fascinated by the ways in which the picture book can borrow and combine diverse elements from other art forms to achieve startling and moving effects.</p><p>The turning page, for example, gives the illustrator the chance to utilize the elements of surprise to advance the movement of the story, and to deepen the involvement of the viewer in much the same way that the theatrical director uses the revolving stages or the rising curtain between thescenes and acts of a play.</p><p>An awareness of movement is extremely important in the conception of a picture book. My favorite illustrators delineate their characters so that animation is implied. The individual spreads are designed so that they crackle with graphic vitality. The characters seem to speak, cavort, andleap from the page so energetically that their life and movement are totally convincing. The moving qualities of each picture are heightened by the placement of the turning pages within the unfolding narrative and by the conception of the book as a whole. It is here that one sees the relationship between the arts of picture book design and filmmaking, as both of them deal with thephenomenon of "moving pictures."</p><p>No one will deny that language can be musical, and certainly visual images can suggest different forms of music by the feelings that they convey. The musical qualities of the pictures and the words can be orchestrated by the artist as he moves them across the pages of the book. Rhythms and harmonies can be established on some spreads, and atonal effects or dissonances can be introduced on others.</p><p>There are limitless possibilities available to the artist, who sets up relationships and tensionsbetween the illustrations and the text, allowing magical discoveries and subtle revelations to emerge in the areas between. When this happens, there is an uncanny fusion of all the elements,and the dynamic new expression that is created introduces young readers to the world of art.</p>Kindergarten-Grade 3&#x2014;This peppy new rendition bears little resemblance to the original legend. The story focuses on Peterkin, a happy elf who stumbles upon a gloomy retired witch named Elbavol. His attempts to cheer her fail, but she sends him off with a magic pipe, which plays the sound of letters. Spelling a word calls it forth, and reversing the letters changes it into something else. So when Peterkin comes to a city plagued by rats and run by a cruel Grand Duke, he uses his pipe to call up the rats and then changes them into stars. However, he still must claim his reward from the Duke. Clever readers may guess the mystery behind Elbavol's name before Peterkin does. This story does not have the haunting, thought-provoking qualities of the legend, nor is it very scary&#x2014;even the rats are cute. Bright cartoon illustrations in sunshine yellows burst with colorful hearts, flowers, and rainbows except for in the contrasting dark, decrepit areas surrounding Elbavol. Children will enjoy this story without knowing the original tale, but to know only this version would be a shame.&#x2014;<i>Julie Roach, Cambridge Public Library, MA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It&#x2019;s just another day and just another number. I won&#x2019;t feel any different before, during, or after that day than I do on any other. But this time of year . . . bad things always seem to happen around my birthday.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; My lover&#x2019;s voice slipped from sexy and teasing to quiet and serious in a heartbeat. He didn&#x2019;t say anything else. He knew exactly what bad things I was referring to. My mother and my older sister being murdered. Thinking that Bria, my baby sister, had also been killed. Fletcher Lane, my mentor, being tortured to death.<br> <br>&#x201c;I just . . . don&#x2019;t want to jinx things by talking about my birthday,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And I don&#x2019;t even want to think about the surprise party Finn is planning.&#x201d;<br> <br>Silence.<br> <br>&#x201c;What party?&#x201d; Owen finally asked, three seconds too late to be believable.<br> <br>&#x201c;The always party.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; he asked again, genuinely confused this time.<br> <br>&#x201c;The always party. The party that Finn always plans for me. The one I always tell him I would rather do without. The one the sneaky bastard always manages to surprise me with anyway, just when I think that I&#x2019;m finally safe from him and his shenanigans.&#x201d;<br> <br>Finnegan Lane, my foster brother, thought that birthdays were a time of great celebration, jubilation, and excitement and should always be marked with cake, presents, and people hiding in a dark room waiting to jump out and scream at you the second you turned on the lights. I was fine with the cake and the presents, but people jumping and screaming in my direction always made me reach for one of my silverstone knives.<br> <br>Such were the instincts of an assassin.<br> <br>&#x201c;He always manages to surprise you with a party?&#x201d; Owen asked. &#x201c;Every single year? I find that hard to believe.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, well, I am no match for the mercurial wiles of Finnegan Lane. Three years ago, he threw the party a week before my birthday. Two years ago, he waited until three weeks after my birthday.&#x201d;<br> <br>Last year had been the only one in the last ten that Finn hadn&#x2019;t thrown me a party, since Fletcher had been murdered right around that time. Neither one of us had felt like celebrating anything then.<br> <br>I skirted around a janitor who was mopping the linoleum floor. The sun slanting in through the windows made the smooth surface gleam like a new penny, but the longer I stared at the drying streaks of water, the darker they became, turning a dull, rusty red and morphing into another liquid. Blood. Fletcher&#x2019;s blood, oozing all over the blue and pink pig tracks on the floor of the Pork Pit&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;Gin?&#x201d; Owen asked. &#x201c;Are you still there?&#x201d;<br> <br>I shook my head to get rid of the unwanted memories. &#x201c;Sorry, I&#x2019;m still in one of the buildings. The reception is terrible in here. Hang on a second, and let me go outside.&#x201d;<br> <br>I reached the end of the corridor and pushed through the doors, stepping out onto one of the quads at Ashland Community College. Stone buildings ringed the open grassy space, and a couple of maples towered up out of the ground, their red- and orange-streaked leaves providing patches of dappled shade that danced over the lawn. After the intense air-conditioning inside the building, the humid heat of the September evening felt like a warm, welcome blanket wrapping around my body. I tilted my face up to the sun, enjoying the sensation, before it turned into the inevitable, muggy, stifling burn.<br> <br>Students moved back and forth across the quad, staring at their phones as they headed to other buildings or stepped onto the cobblestone paths that wound through campus and over to the parking lots. It was after seven now, and this was the last class period of the day, so everyone was ready to go somewhere else for the night, whether it was to the library to study, home to Mom and Dad&#x2019;s to do laundry, or to a nearby bar to soak their overworked brain cells in enough alcohol to make them forget everything they&#x2019;d learned today.<br> <br>I stopped long enough to heft my backpack, with its pens, notebook, and copy of You Only Live Twice by Ian Fleming, a little higher on my shoulder. The book was for the spy-literature course I was taking. I liked learning new things, so I was something of a perpetual student at the college, always signing up for a class or two every semester. When I was younger, the classes had helped kill the time between my assignments as the assassin the Spider. Now the classes helped kill the time between people trying to murder me because I was the Spider. Funny how much my life had changed in the last year.<br> <br>&#x201c;Gin?&#x201d; Owen asked again. &#x201c;Are you still there?&#x201d;<br> <br>I meandered toward the parking lot where my car was. &#x201c;Anyway, as I was saying, every year, I beg and plead for Finn to forget about throwing me any sort of party, and he always pays absolutely no attention to me whatsoever.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you want me to talk to him?&#x201d;<br> <br>I snorted. &#x201c;You can try, but he won&#x2019;t listen.&#x201d;<br> <br>Owen laughed. &#x201c;Yeah, probably not.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Just try to rein him in a little bit, okay? I don&#x2019;t need some enormous party with streamers and balloons and stuff. A nice, quiet dinner with you, Finn, and Bria would be great.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Streamers and balloons? Sounds like he really goes all out,&#x201d; Owen teased.<br> <br>&#x201c;You have no idea,&#x201d; I grumbled again. &#x201c;Those parties?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;One of them featured a petting zoo. Finn rented a bouncy house for the other one. Set it up on the lawn outside Fletcher&#x2019;s house. I went over there after work one day, and surprise!&#x201d;<br> <br>Owen laughed again at my snarky tone. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see what I can do.&#x201d;<br> <br>We started chatting about other things, and I let his voice wash over me, enjoying the deep, familiar rumble of his words. All the while, though, I focused on my surroundings, scanning the quads, peering into doorways, and easing around corners in case anyone was lying in wait for me. A vampire baring his fangs in anticipation of sinking his incisors into me. A giant flexing her hands, eager to wrap them around my throat and strangle me. A dwarf rolling his shoulders, ready to tackle me and beat my head against the ground. A Fire elemental cupping flames in the palm of her hand, preparing to roast me with her magic.<br> <br>Just because no one had attempted to kill me at the community college yet didn&#x2019;t mean that some enterprising fool wouldn&#x2019;t have the bright idea to try. They&#x2019;d certainly made the effort pretty much everywhere else I went. So many people had tried to murder me at my barbecue restaurant, the Pork Pit, that I&#x2019;d lost count of how many of them I&#x2019;d offed instead.<br> <br>People had been trying to take me out ever since I killed Mab Monroe, the head of the Ashland underworld, back in the winter. With Mab gone, there was an opening for a new king or queen of crime in the city, and many folks saw my murder, the Spider&#x2019;s murder, as a stepping-stone to the throne.<br> <br>Me? Well, at first, I&#x2019;d just been trying to fly under the radar and survive all of the assassination attempts. But now people were really starting to piss me off. You&#x2019;d think that I had killed enough lowlifes for all the others to get the message to leave me the fuck alone already, but apparently, brains were not in abundance in Ashland. Shocking, I know.<br> <br>But I made it over to the parking lot without anyone jumping out of the shadows, shouting, screaming, and trying to shoot, stab, bludgeon, or magic me to death. Still, I remained vigilant as I approached my car, since this area was close to Southtown, the dangerous part of Ashland, home to gangbangers, hookers, their pimps, and down-on-their-luck homeless bums. And those were some of the nicer folks around here. They wouldn&#x2019;t care about murdering me because I was the Spider. They&#x2019;d be more than happy to kill me for my phone, my car keys, and what might be in my wallet.<br> <br>I stopped at the end of the path and scanned the lot in front of me. Like most places this close to Southtown, the area was a bit worse for wear. Jagged cracks zigzagged across the pavement, before collapsing into wide potholes, while the white paint that marked the parking spaces was so faded that you could barely make out the lines. Fast-food bags, crushed cigarettes, and jumbo-size soda cups overflowed out of the trash cans, and the steady breeze sent them gusting along the blacktop, along with the tinkle-tinkle-tinkle of glass from broken beer bottles.<br> <br>A variety of gang runes and graffiti tags had been spray-painted onto the concrete barriers that cordoned off the lot from the construction site next door. The words Vaughn Construction were embossed on a metal sign hanging on the chain-link fence that ran behind the barriers, although the V in Vaughn had been turned into a giant red heart, thanks to some tagger&#x2019;s artistic talents. I made a mental note to get Finn to find out what Charlotte Vaughn was building here. Or perhaps I&#x2019;d pay Charlotte a visit one night and ask her myself.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t see anyone, but instead of moving forward, I held my position and reached out with my magic. People&#x2019;s feelings, actions, and intentions sink into whatever stone is around them, and as a Stone elemental, I can hear and interpret all of those emotional vibrations. Like, say, if someone was lurking behind one of those concrete barriers, a gun in his hand, ready to rise up and shoot me the second I was in range, then the barriers would mutter to me, the same way a man might mutter under his breath as he impatiently waited for me to hurry up and get here, already.<br> <br>But the concrete and the pavement only grumbled with displeasure about all of the spray paint, cracks, and potholes that marred their surfaces. No one was here to try to kill me. Good. Perhaps I would actually get through one day without having to fight for my life.<br> <br>I strolled through the lot, listening to Owen and still looking for any signs of trouble, but my silver Aston Martin was right where I&#x2019;d left it. I&#x2019;d bought the car a few weeks ago at Finn&#x2019;s insistence. He had demanded that I have my own Aston, since I had a bad habit of getting his keyed, beaten, dented, bloodied, and generally destroyed.<br> <br>I glanced around a final time, still half-expecting some idiot to pop up from between two cars, yell, and charge at me with a weapon, but I was the only one here, so I focused on my conversation with Owen again.<br> <br>&#x201c;So what&#x2019;s on tap for tonight?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I thought we would stay in and have a quiet evening. You, me, a nice dinner, perhaps some quality time watching TV in my bedroom.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Watching TV? Really?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, if you absolutely insist, we can skip the TV-viewing portion of the evening,&#x201d; Owen suggested in a husky tone.<br> <br>Even though he couldn&#x2019;t see me, I still smiled. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br> <br>He laughed, and we kept chatting as I pulled my keys out of my jeans pocket and unlocked the car door&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where do you think you&#x2019;re going?&#x201d;<br> <br>The harsh words and the smug tone that went with them made me stop and look over my shoulder. While I&#x2019;d been talking to Owen, three twenty-something guys had entered the parking lot, all of them wearing jeans, polo shirts, and sneakers. A girl the same age hurried along in front of them, her arms crossed over her chest and her head down, her speed increasing with every step as she tried to get clear of the guys.<br> <br>The girl&#x2019;s backpack bounced on her right shoulder, and a large pin shaped like a pig holding a plate of food, all done in blue and pink crystals, winked at me. I frowned. I knew that pin. It was a rough approximation of the neon sign that hung outside the Pork Pit. Sophia Deveraux, the head cook, had ordered a whole box of the pig pins and given them to the restaurant&#x2019;s waitstaff to wear.<br> <br>I focused on the girl and realized that I knew her too. Long, wavy black hair, hazel eyes, bronze skin, pretty features. Catalina Vasquez. She worked as a waitress at the Pit and took classes at the college, just like I did.<br> <br>And it looked like she was in trouble, just like I was most days.<br> <br>Catalina scurried forward, moving as fast as she could without actually running, but the guys weren&#x2019;t going to let her get away that easy. One reached forward and grabbed her backpack, jerking it off her shoulder and making it fall to the ground. Books, notepads, pens, and more tumbled out of the bag. Catalina scowled, but she didn&#x2019;t make a move to bend down and pick up her stuff. Instead, she stood her ground, her hands clenched into tight fists, as though she wanted to throw herself at the guys and give them a good pounding.<br> <br>I leaned against the side of my car, watching the situation unfold.<br> <br>&#x201c;Listen, Troy, I&#x2019;ve told you before. I&#x2019;m not into drugs. I don&#x2019;t use them, I don&#x2019;t buy them, I don&#x2019;t sell them, and I sure as hell don&#x2019;t date guys who do,&#x201d; Catalina said.<br> <br>Troy, the guy who&#x2019;d grabbed the backpack, stepped forward. He was around six feet tall, with dirty-blond hair, brown eyes, a beefy build, and a mean smile. My own lips curved in response in a smile that was far meaner than his.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah, come on, Cat,&#x201d; Troy purred, stepping closer to her. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be like that. We used to be friends. We used to be a lot more. I remember how good we were together, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Troy reached out, as if he were going to curl a lock of Catalina&#x2019;s hair around his finger, but she slapped his hand away before he could touch her.<br> <br>&#x201c;That was a long time ago,&#x201d; she snapped. &#x201c;Before I knew better.&#x201d;<br> <br>Troy&#x2019;s eyes narrowed. &#x201c;You know, given our history, I was going to be nice about this. Not anymore.&#x201d;<br> <br>He snapped his fingers. One of the other guys stepped forward, unzipped the black backpack he was holding, and pulled out a fistful of plastic bags, all filled with pills. He handed the bags to Troy, who held them up so that Catalina could see them.<br> <br>&#x201c;All you gotta do is take these pills over to that barbecue restaurant where you work and pass them out to the waiters and the customers,&#x201d; Troy said. &#x201c;Give them out here on campus too. Think of them as free samples.&#x201d;<br> <br>He snickered, and so did the other two guys.<br> <br>Catalina&#x2019;s jaw clenched tight, and she glared at Troy, her hazel eyes almost black with anger. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not pushing your pills. Forget it. Find someone else to sell that poison for you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Troy reached toward her a second time, but Catalina slapped his hand away again. Troy surged forward, and the other two guys stepped up behind him, the three of them crowding Catalina and forcing her to back up ...</p><h2>Tassel Making: Revealing the Secrets of How to Make the World&#39;s Most Gorgeous Fabric Decorations</h2><p>The beautiful art of passementerie made simple &#x2015; the definitive contemporary approach to a traditional craft. 40 original projects, with step-by-step photographic instruction, including lavish curtain tie-backs, decorative light pulls, simple key tassels and natural-look tassels made out of jute.

Mencken, and perhaps no American ever wrote more stylish prose. In this sequel to the landmark Mencken Chrestomathy of nearly 50 years ago, the genius of Mencken&#39;s commentary and the stunning breadth of his interests -- from music to politics to fine art to the brewer&#39;s art -- are displayed in all their eloquent grandeur. The essays, reviews, and examples of brilliant reporting were all selected by Mencken himself, and today&#39;s thinking readers are fortunate to finally see publication of this fine book some forty years after Mencken&#39;s death.Following My Life as Author and Editor (1993) and Fred Hobson's biography , the Menckenian revival continues apace with this sparkling successor to the first chrestomathy, which was a best-seller in 1949. More than an anthology, the second volume represents pieces (some previously unpublished) that Mencken himself selected and revised before his stroke aborted the project; another proposal to publish came to nought in 1963. Over 60 percent of the 238 items, many from Mencken's magazines Smart Set and American Mercury, are not available elsewhere, which in itself makes the publication of this title something of a literary event. That it parades again the sage of Baltimore in his incisive, if often irksome, eloquence only confirms him as one of the better belletrists of the century. The job of discriminator of taste exists to be seized in any age, and in the teens and twenties, Mencken extolled and excoriated with idiosyncratic abandon. The books and music he reviewed have faded from memory, but his satirical exfoliations remain fresh, for example, in praise of a bartender's memoir of the bibulous arts or in contempt for a Rotarian's history of his organization. Edited by New York critic Terry Teachout, who is preparing his own biography of the provocateur, this entertaining, exasperating collection captures Mencken's gloomy view of human nature and his bright delight in stripping from it all cant and concealment. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>Capturing Jonathan Pollard: How One of the Most Notorious Spies in American History Was Brought to Justice</h2><p>Jonathan Jay Pollard, an intelligence analyst working in the U.S. Naval Investigative Service&#x2019;s Anti-Terrorist Alert Center, systematically stole highly sensitive security secrets from almost every major intelligence-gathering agency in the United States. Over the course of eighteen months in the mid 1980s, he took and subsequently sold to Israel more than one million pages of classified material, enough to fill a six-by-ten-foot room stacked six feet high. No other spy in the history of the United States has stolen so many secrets, so highly classified, in such a short period of time. Ronald J. Olive, the author of this book was the assistant special agent in charge of counterintelligence in the Washington office of the Naval Investigative Service who led the whirlwind investigation against Pollard. Olive interrogated Pollard and garnered the confession that led to his arrest in November 1985 and eventual life sentence. <p>During the twenty plus years that Pollard has spent in prison, many questions have arisen about the case because it never went to trial and so much information surrounding it remains classified. Most of the books and articles that have been written about Pollard denounce his life sentence as unjust. </p><p>This book tells the other side of the story. It is an account from deep inside the espionage investigation that gives details of Pollard&#x2019;s confession immediately following his arrest and describes Pollard&#x2019;s interaction with the author before and during the time suspicion about his activities was mounting. Revealed are countless other details that have never before been made public. Calling the Pollard story an extreme case of a counterintelligence failure, Olive writes that mistaken assumptions and leadership failures enabled Pollard to ransack America&#x2019;s defense intelligence long after he should have been fired. The author hopes the vital insights his book offers will serve as a lesson in history and prevent similar problems in the future and provide an antidote to the uncertainty that has fueled speculation, rumor, and lies surrounding the Pollard case.</p></p><p>Ronald J. Olive spent thirty years in law enforcement, including twenty-two with the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), mostly in counterintelligence. Since his retirement in 1999, he has run his own consulting and confidential investigations company near Phoenix, Arizona.</p><h2>Letters to an American Lady</h2><p>On October 26, 1950, C. S. Lewis wrote the first of more than a hundred letters he would send to a woman he had never met, but with whom he was to maintain a correspondence for the rest of his life.<br><br>Ranging broadly in subject matter, the letters discuss topics as profound as the love of God and as frivolous as preferences in cats. Lewis himself clearly had no idea that these letters would ever see publication, but they reveal facets of his character little known even to devoted readers of his fantasy and scholarly writings -- a man patiently offering encouragement and guidance to another Christian through the day-to-day joys and sorrows of ordinary life.<br><br><i>Letters to an American Lady</i> stands as a fascinating and moving testimony to the remarkable humanity and even more remarkable Christianity of C. S. Lewis, and is richly deserving of the position it now takes among the balance of his Christian writings.</p><p>C. S. Lewis (1898-1963) taught English literature at both Oxford and Cambridge Universities and wrote more than thirty influential scholarly and popular books.

It includes 25 maps showing the distribution of species and forest-products industries in addition to a full-color, large, fold-out map that shows the extent of the first growth forest, second and third growth forest, agricultural lands, burned areas, reforested areas, and landslides. Five sections look at plant migrations to the region following the last glaciation, the impact of people on the forest, the forest regrown, mountain ranges, forest industries. A must for anyone who loves the Catskills.</p><p>When Michael Kudish first began climbing the Catskills peaks in the mid-1960s, he wondered why different summits at the same elevation had vastly different forests, some with spruce-fir, some with fir-northern hardwoods, others with northern hardwoods alone, and still others with oak. To answer this question, he began a life-long study of the history of these forests, beginning with Vegetational History of the Catskill High Peaks, his dissertation at the New York State College of Environmental Science and Forestry at Syracuse in 1971. In the intervening 29 years, his study has expanded to include an examination of Catskills soils, climate, ecological personalities of tree species, human disturbance history, and the history recorded in the rings of living and just fallen trees. Such examinations could punch the clock back only 300 to 400 years, the maximum age of the oldest living trees and of the writings of European settlers. In 1994, He realized that tree fossils preserved in high-elevation peat bogs also could be used to reconstruct forest history and that the age of the peat could be determined by radiocarbon dating.

This book, long overdue by those who knew Rolling Thunder and his work, is a major legacy of his extraordinary life and the summation of his teachings and in his own words. As controversial and plain-speaking as Rolling Thunder himself, it exhorts, enlightens, and teaches through anecdotes and stories, forces us to listen and to think, and carries on his primary mission: to bring Indian knowledge to non-Indian people. <br><br>Rolling Thunder Speaks represents the gathering of over thirty years of his tapes and writings, in addition to stories, lessons, and conversations remembered by his widow, Sun Rising Pope. A Cherokee of the Blue Paint or Medicine People clan, Rolling Thunder mastered the Cherokee, Shoshone, Paiute, Sioux, and Tuscarora medicine traditions and healed and instructed both Indians and non-Indians for over forty years. The book describes the basic beliefs and practices of traditional Native American spirituality and training and tools of medicine people. It includes Rolling Thunder's instructions for meditation and prayer, protection against bad spirits, and the use of certain herbal remedies, as well as accounts of history according to Indian beliefs, discussions of karma and the political realities faced by Native Americans, American Indian prophecies, Rolling Thunder's personal visions. Sun Rising Pope has put together all this knowledge in a faithful rendering.

Two days later he died and his assailants, James Norris and William Armstrong, were arrested and charged with his murder. Norris was tried and convicted first. As William "Duff" Armstrong waited for his trial, his own father died. James Armstrong's deathbed wish was that Duff's mother, Hannah, engage the best lawyer possible to defend Duff. The best person Hannah could think of was a friend, a young lawyer from Springfield by the name of Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln took the case and with that begins one of the oddest journeys Lincoln took on his trek towards immortality. What really happened? How much did the moon reveal? What did Lincoln really know? Walsh makes a strong case for viewing Honest Abe in a different light in this tale of murder and moonlight.</p><p><i>Moonlight</i> is a 2001 Edgar Award Nominee for Best Fact Crime.</p></p><p><p><b>John Evangelist Walsh</b> is the author of more than a dozen books of history and biography, including <i>Midnight Dreary: The Mysterios Death of Edgar Allen Poe</i> ; <i>Unraveling Piltdown: The Science Fraud of the Century and Its Solution</i> ; and <i>The Shadows Rise: Abraham Licoln and the Ann Rutledge Legend</i>.</p>The true significance of the Almanac Trial is revealed by historical detective and novelist Walsh (Midnight Dreary, 1998, etc.) in this engrossing account of how history is made and lost.In November 1857, less than a year before the Lincoln-Douglas debates, the lawyer and would-be senator from Springfield, Illinois, received a request he felt he had to honor. It was the dying wish of an old friend, James Armstrong, that Lincoln represent his son, who was on trial for murder. Lincoln was not, in fact, an especially good criminal defense attorney: Walsh documents that, prior to the Armstrong case, when faced with a client's certain guilt, Honest Abe would either pull out of the defense or end up doing such a half-hearted job that the accused would get convicted anyway. One defense witness in the Armstrong case hinted broadly at the guilt of the defendant by stating that he knew too much to be of much use and, after the trial, told a juror that he had seen the defendant commit the crime. (This last delicious tidbit was uncovered by an amateur historian 50 years later, but it has been hitherto ignored.) No one knows if Lincoln thought his client was guilty, but if he did, it didn't show. He gave his client a tough, artful defense, which included consulting an almanac to discredit a prosecution witness who claimed that he saw the murder clearly because the moon was high in the sky. (The almanac showed that the moon was lower on the horizon.) In considering what Lincoln might have known about the case, Walsh wonders, which is more in order for what he did, censure or sympathy? But his telling of the conflict between honesty and loyalty that Lincoln likely faced is clearly sympathetic. Perhaps it is simply the contemporary climate that leads Walsh to ask this question--as if the story he has told is not interesting enough. A fascinating study of an intriguing case.

At the war&#x2019;s end, the national government owed tremendous sums to foreign creditors and its own citizens. But lacking the power to tax, it had no means to repay them. <i>The Founders and Finance</i> is the first book to tell the story of how foreign-born financial specialists&#x2015;immigrants&#x2015;solved the fiscal crisis and set the United States on a path to long-term economic success.</p><p>Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning author Thomas K. McCraw analyzes the skills and worldliness of Alexander Hamilton (from the Danish Virgin Islands), Albert Gallatin (from the Republic of Geneva), and other immigrant founders who guided the nation to prosperity. Their expertise with liquid capital far exceeded that of native-born plantation owners Washington, Jefferson, and Madison, who well understood the management of land and slaves but had only a vague knowledge of financial instruments&#x2015;currencies, stocks, and bonds. The very rootlessness of America&#x2019;s immigrant leaders gave them a better understanding of money, credit, and banks, and the way each could be made to serve the public good.</p><p>The remarkable financial innovations designed by Hamilton, Gallatin, and other immigrants enabled the United States to control its debts, to pay for the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, and&#x2015;barely&#x2015;to fight the War of 1812, which preserved the nation&#x2019;s hard-won independence from Britain.</p></p><p>Thomas K. McCraw was Straus Professor of Business History Emeritus at Harvard Business School and winner of the Pulitzer Prize for History.&#x201c;Well told by McCraw are the familiar stories of Hamilton&#x2019;s consolidation and funding of the public debt, of his incessant fighting with Thomas Jefferson, and of his final duel with Aaron Burr... McCraw shows just how different was Jefferson&#x2019;s party from the one doing business under the Republican banner today.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>James Grant</b><b>, </b><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;As Thomas K. McCraw relates here, America lurched from one financial crisis to another between 1780 and 1840. At many times, it was entirely plausible that the young nation&#x2019;s financial troubles might disintegrate it... The achievements of Morris, Hamilton, and Gallatin cannot be overstated. They erected America&#x2019;s &#x2018;basic capitalist framework&#x2019; by establishing a steady national currency and loosed gushing wells of both private and public credit. These immigrants also fashioned a system of taxation and collection, tamed the nation&#x2019;s debt, and fostered the development of a manufacturing economy. And these astonishing achievements came despite ardent political opposition... The lessons of <i>The Founders and Finance</i> are that America&#x2019;s finances have been far worse than they are today, and that good policies can triumph over political stupidity.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Kevin R. Kosar</b><b>, </b><b><i>Weekly Standard</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;We may not know what we are doing with our own public finances, but perhaps we may take some comfort in the fact that the Founders, two centuries ago, did not know what they were doing, either.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Gordon Wood</b><b>, </b><b><i>New Republic</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A detailed account of the financial negotiations that helped underwrite the United States might not strike some readers as inherently gripping fare, but McCraw has made it every bit as interesting as the more standard accounts of battling redcoats. Men like Morris, Gallatin, and Hamilton had enormous potential to become &#x2018;the most dangerous men in the world&#x2019; (in fact they did become so, in the eyes of their many enemies), and <i>The Founders and Finance</i> takes us into the heart of their temptations.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Steve Donoghue</b><b>, </b><b><i>Open Letters Monthly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;If you think the current system is a mess, consider the national economy after the American Revolution... A welcome addition to business and financial history, illuminating little-known aspects of the early republic.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Only two men are honored with statues outside the U.S. Treasury building: Alexander Hamilton and Albert Gallatin. McCraw explores their qualities, foibles, achievements, and failures in order to show why both deserve credit for laying the foundations of American governmental finance... McCraw is a talented storyteller. His highly readable and fascinating work portrays the brilliance of Hamilton and Gallatin against the difficulty of their time and is strongly recommended to all readers interested in American and financial history.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Lawrence Maxted</b><b>, </b><b><i>Library Journal (starred review)</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;McCraw sheds light on personalities and policies in this overview of the development of early American finance. The newly independent United States &#x2018;had long been bankrupt&#x2019;; both the fledgling national government and the states were in hock for the War of Independence... Hamilton&#x2019;s decisive advocacy of a national bank and assumption of state war debts laid the basis for economic expansion and cemented the dominance of federal power. McCraw then turns to Gallatin&#x2019;s ascendancy in Congress, where in 1796 he denounced the growth in the national debt and decried high military spending. Starting with the still-resonant contrast between the &#x2018;big government&#x2019; Hamilton and &#x2018;small government&#x2019; Gallatin, McCraw&#x2019;s wealth of historical data should interest any lay historian, particularly when he presents the many &#x2018;what if&#x2019;s.&#x2019;&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Consistently interesting and beautifully written, McCraw&#x2019;s narratives of the careers of Hamilton and Gallatin are simply splendid. We are in the hands of a master storyteller, as well as a master analyst of historical materials.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Robin Einhorn, University of California, Berkeley</b><br><br>&#x201c;A compulsively readable book that is both a dual biography of the two most influential Treasury Secretaries and a study of American exceptionalism&#x2015;the way in which immigrants played a leading role in building American institutions.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Harold James, author of <i>Making the European Monetary Union</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;McCraw has observed a singular fact about this nation&#x2019;s early history: most of the people who directed its finances were immigrants. From Alexander Hamilton to Albert Gallatin, McCraw traces the influence of these remarkable foreign-born financiers, and reveals how their partly-imported sensibilities averted what seemed to be the fledgling republic&#x2019;s most likely fate: bankruptcy.

Seth has reconstructed the true life story of our greaatest president for the first time---all while revealing the hidden history behind the Civil War and uncovering the role vampires played in the birth, growth, and near-death of our nation.</p><p><i>Let Us Build Us a City</i> is a group portrait of 11 "lost towns" in Donald Harington's native Arkansas. Yet this is no mere backwoods travelogue. His book, the author tells us, is "the story of communities that aspired to dignity and achieved serenity." These are towns, in other words, whose ambitious founders never quite managed to merge imagination with reality. "How does a once-flourishing town aspiring to call itself 'City' endure the long days of its decline?" asks Harington. The answer, in most cases, is quite well--though not perhaps in the way its inhabitants intended. One need not be familiar with Arkansas to appreciate this tour of lonely highways; there are lost towns everywhere. But seldom are they explored with such joy and wonder as in this gem of a book.<p> For all its brilliance, <i>Let Us Build Us a City</i> is nearly impossible to classify. It fuses the travel narrative with history and cultural studies--yet it reads like a novel. It's also a love story that is in no way fictional. Harington begins with a letter from a woman named Kim, who writes to praise his earlier book, <i>Some Other Place, the Right Place</i>. (Since the latter work is itself about a young couple's exploration of ghost towns and their subsequent romance, things immediately get off to a metafictional start.) Kim's letter leads to regular correspondence, in which she details the research she's conducting in one-horse towns throughout Arkansas. The author encourages her, she inspires him, and they agree to collaborate on a book--this one. By the time they meet, they too have learned something of expectation and hope. (Yes, they do get married, although you'll have to read the acknowledgments for details of the ceremony.) </p><p> Ultimately, Harington's book is a search for the spirit of each individual place--which is to say, the people. These lost towns are populated by dreamers, outcasts, prevaricators, drunks, madmen, and hermits. There are tales of floods, fires, gold rushes, gunshots, feuds, booms and (mostly) busts, along with other tidbits so strange they could only be true. By themselves, these would be deeply entertaining yarns. In Harington's hands, however, they amount to eloquent requiems for all his stunted cities. And perhaps these Arkansans traded in their dashed dreams for something better. After all, serenity is an admirable quality in a town, even if it happens to be an accidental one. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i></p>Although he was born and raised in Little Rock, Donald Harington spent nearly all of his early summers in the Ozark mountain hamlet of Drakes Creek, his mother&#39;s hometown, where his grandparents operated the general store and post office. There, before he lost his hearing to meningitis at the age of twelve, he listened carefully to the vanishing Ozark folk language and the old tales told by story-tellers. His academic career is in art and art history and he has taught art history at a variety of colleges, including his alma mater, the University of Arkansas. His first novel was published by Random House in 1965, and since then he has published twelve other novels, most of them set in the Ozark hamlet of his own creation, Stay More, based loosely upon Drakes Creek. He has also written books about artists. He won the Robert Penn Warren Award in 2003, the Porter Prize in 1987, the Heasley Prize at Lyon College in 1998, was inducted into the Arkansas Writers&#39; Hall of Fame in 1999 and that same year won the Arkansas Fiction Award of the Arkansas Library Association. He has been called &#34;an undiscovered continent&#34; (Fred Chappell) and &#34;America&#39;s Greatest Unknown Novelist&#34; (Entertainment Weekly).</p><h2>Symbolism</h2><p>A key movement in modern art &#34;To clothe the idea in perceptible form,&#34; proposed the poet Jean Mor�as in his 1886 Manifesto of Symbolism. It was in France and Belgium, the cradles of literary Symbolism, that Symbolist painting was born. It plunged headlong into the cultural space opened up by the poetry of Baudelaire and Mallarm� and by the operas of Wagner. Symbolist painters sought not to represent appearances but to express &#34;the Idea,&#34; and the imaginary therefore plays an important part in their work. &#34;Dream&#34; was their credo; they execrated, with a fanatical hatred, impressionism, realism, naturalism, and the scientistic. The main principle of Symbolism, that of &#34;correspondences,&#34; was to attain harmony between all the different arts, or even to realise the total work of art (Gesamtkunstwerk) that Wagner had dreamt of creating. What we rediscover today, after a period of neglect, is this: Symbolist painting is essential to our understanding of modern art, not only because it spread across the world like wildfire, creating disciples from Russia to the United States, from Northern Europe to the Mediterranean, but because it was the source of a series of mutations without which modern art would not be what it is.</p><p>Gilles N�ret was an art historian, journalist, writer, and museum correspondent. He organized several art retrospectives in Japan and founded the SEIBU museum and the Wildenstein Gallery in Tokyo. He directed art reviews such as L&#x2019;Oeil and Connaissance des Arts and received the Elie Faure Prize in 1981 for his publications. N�ret is the editor of TASCHEN'S catalogues raisonn�s of the works of Monet and Vel�zquez, as well as the author of Dali The Paintings and Erotica Universalis.

Schulz was born in 1922 in Minneapolis, the only child of a housewife and a barber. His interest in comics was encouraged by his father, who loved the funny pages. After army duty, Schulz lettered comic pages for <i>Timeless Topix</i>, and sold seventeen cartoons to <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i> from 1948 to 1950 and a feature,<i> Li'l Folks</i>, to the <i>St. Paul Pioneer Press</i>. <i>Peanuts</i> debuted on October 2, 1950, and ran without interruption for the next fifty years. Schulz died on February 12, 2000, and his last strip ran the next day. <i>Peanuts</i> has appeared in 2,600 newspapers in seventy-five countries.INTRODUCTION:<br><br>Sparky was a genius.<br><br>That is the answer to the unanswerable questions of "why" and "how." I recognized it when I first knew him, I spent the next 25 years asking the same things others ask, and always came back to the same answer. The essence of his genius is: We can't know it, quantify it, explain it; we can, simply, enjoy it. If those of us who are part of his circle puzzle over the questions and struggle for answers, no one struggled more than Sparky himself.<br><br>He understood intuitively things he couldn't explain. Things he couldn't even put into words. He could go only so far as to answer the perennial question "Where do your ideas come from?" <br><br>The ideas Sparky used are out there in the world. We all know them and that is why we relate to them. It is the particular twist Sparky put to the ideas that described his genius, and that draws us, enchanted, into his frame. <br><br>I believe there are people of genius around us, but few are fortunate enough to have their genius match the moment. A thousand years ago, Sparky would have been a storyteller, the person in the tribe or the clan who collected the tribal lore and repeated it for each generation. He understood instinctively the value of the story which illustrates a human truth, and which allows his listeners to take from it what they need at the time. The best stories can be told over and over again--forever new--because the listener changes. <br><br>Sparky loved his <i>Big-Little Books</i> when he was small, when he was in high school he escaped into the world of Sherlock Holmes, and always he loved adventure comics. He actually wanted to draw an adventure strip, but it was the wistful, innocent way he illustrated an emotion, expressed through the eyes of a small person, that caught the attention of the comics editors. And so it was children he drew on for his cartoons.<br><br>Children, he would have told you, are simply adults "with the lids still on." He believed firmly that we are the product of our genes and that all of the characteristics are there within us as children, simmering, waiting to emerge. So the envy and anger expressed in "Good Ol' Charlie Brown. How I hate him" in the first strip, shocks us, but Sparky knew, whether or not we want to admit it, children feel that emotion. When Sparky saw a child with a very strong personality, he observed how difficult that person would be "when the lid comes off."<br><br>Sparky loved to sit in his ice arena over lunch and have an interesting and varied group around, and he was very good in front of an audience. He knew how to draw his story out to hold people's attention. His directness enlivened any conversation and he probed others with questions. In these situations he was like the storyteller of old--interacting with his audience in a very intimate way. <br><br>But the comic strip is a long way from the storyteller of a thousand years ago. The cartoonist puts his drawings and words on paper and it is weeks before his audience sees them. Immediacy and personality must be elucidated in a different way. The comic strip storyteller of 20th century America has to tell a story that stretches across 3000 miles, and draw scenes of snow pranks that make people laugh in Hawaii as well as in Vermont or Michigan.<br><br>Like the novelist, the cartoonist must go into himself or herself, and draw upon what is there. It is a solitary craft.<br><br>Sparky frequently wasn't sure if something he'd drawn was funny. Certainly he'd receive feedback, but it would be months later. The spontaneity was missing. Often I'd stop at his studio and look over a stack of dailies on his desk. When I laughed out loud, or told him how funny I thought they were, he was truly grateful. "Oh, I'm so glad you think it's funny. I'm never sure," he'd say. He loved people's positive responses, and at the same time, he had to shut out the voices. He had to draw what he thought was funny and hope that his audience liked it too. He was always glad to know people liked his characters or a particular storyline, but he knew he couldn't write to that audience; he always wrote for himself.<br><br>He began quite early in his career to use biblical references. Occasionally, someone would write to say, "How dare you use religious material in a comic strip?" His response was that as long as he had used the reference with integrity, he was satisfied that he was on firm ground. On the other hand, once in the 70s, he used a take-off on the title <i>I Heard the Owl Call My Name</i>. He got a letter saying this was a sacred phrase in a Native American tribe. Sparky wrote an apology. He admitted he hadn't realized that he was overstepping propriety. <br><br>Sparky sometimes tried out an idea on me or others. For example he'd say, "How would it be if Charlie Brown goes to camp and meets this other kid who won't say anything except 'Shut up and leave me alone.'?" Well, it's difficult to imagine that as a funny storyline, but I knew better than to say no, and of course, because of the funny drawing and the particular way he paced the strip and the story, it became a funny sequence. If this or any new character made for a good storyline, Sparky might go back and resurrect the character a year later for a second camp episode, but more often than not, that first appearance would be the last. He explained that the character was too one-dimensional to create opportunities for humor.<br><br>In order to produce a strip every day, he had to rely on characters whose personalities themselves engendered ideas. Sparky always had a pen handy to write down any notions that came to him, or if we were in the car he'd ask me to write for him. Frequently, at the symphony, I'd see him reach into his pocket for his pad and pencil. On the way home he'd tell me the idea he had--but what he related to me at the time was only the germ of what would become a fully realized daily or Sunday page. He could come up with ideas from almost any situation because his characters had such distinct personalities and idiosyncrasies.<br><br>As much as most of us are drawn to the personalities and the situations and the lines the characters deliver, Sparky was always quick to point out that the appeal of <i>Peanuts</i> is still funny drawing. He would use a yellow lined pad to "doodle," drawing the characters in antic poses, rolling over, flying upside down, etc. These provided him with ideas.<br><br>When the strip ended, the response was overwhelming. Sparky touched people deeply and often changed their lives, as the thousands of letters attested:<br><br><i>"I remember [as a child] often being consumed by feelings of profound anxiety and unrest, and yet as soon as I could come home to read my </i>Peanuts<i> books, I was peaceful, even happy."</i><br><br><i>"When I was about 11 years old I had to go into the hospital and I was very scared. My mother had to leave me after visiting hours, but my stuffed Snoopy didn't. I held it all night long."</i><br><br><i>"I often identified with Charlie Brown's feelings of inadequacy, of not fitting in anywhere. And my favorite character was always Linus, who was sensible but had an almost magical sense of the power of his innocence and imagination."<br></i><br><i>"Charlie Brown and the gang were a solace and a balm to my soul. I always wanted to tell this to Mr. Schulz. So now I tell you."<br></i><br>Sparky once said, "I would be satisfied if they wrote on my tombstone 'He made people happy.'"<br><br>He did that, and so much more.<br><br>-- Jean Schulz</p><h2>Palace Council (Elm Harbor, Book 3)</h2><p>&#x201c;Carter twists plotlines like pretzels while wryly skewering America&#x2019;s wealthy intellectual elite.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>People</i><br><br>John Grisham called Stephen L.

But Eddie was blessed or perhaps cursed with a dependability that led to a lack of prudence in pursuing his devotion.

He possessed a degree from Amherst, a couple of undistinguished years of graduate work at Brown, a handful of social connections through his mother, and a coveted job on the <i>Amsterdam News</i>, although he quit in disgust three months after starting. He had not realized, he explained in a letter to his beloved sister Junie, how very small and unimportant the position was. Junie, in a mischievous mood, forwarded his letter to their awesomely disapproving father, a Boston pastor and essayist. Actually, he was at this time in Montgomery, Alabama, helping to organize a boycott of local businesses that refused to call Negro patrons &#x201c;Mr.&#x201d; and &#x201c;Mrs.&#x201d; Wesley Senior, as he liked to be called, was a distant relation of William Monroe Trotter, the Negro journalist once arrested after tossing pepper to disrupt a speech by Booker T. Washington, and had inherited some of the fire of that clan. Upon his return to Boston, he answered Junie at once, sending along a surfeit of citations from the New Testament, most on the subject of hard work, commanding his daughter to share them with her brother. Eddie read them all; Second Thessalonians 3:10 sufficiently stoked his fury that he did not write his parents for a month, for Eddie was rather fiery himself. When he at last pulled together enough money from odd jobs to afford a phone, he refused for weeks to give his parents the number. Wesley Senior thought Eddie lazy. But Eddie, to his own way of thinking, was simply focused. He did not want to write about car wrecks and speeches by the great leaders of the rising movement for Negro rights. He wanted to write short stories and novels and decided, in the manner of many an author before him, that earning a living would disturb his muse. So, for a time, he mooched.<br><br>His mother sent money, cars were washed, meals were served, papers were sold. Around the corner from his apartment on 123rd Street was a Jewish grocery&#x2014;that was what they were called, Jewish groceries, a reference to ownership, not cuisine&#x2014;and Eddie for a time earned a second income working nights behind the cash register, reading and writing there on the counter because custom was thin. But a better offer came his way. In those days the seedier side of Harlem was largely run by a worthy named Scarlett, who had risen to power after the legendary Bumpy Johnson, king of the Negro rackets, was sentenced to prison for the third time. Scarlett owned a nightclub on 128th Street and much else besides, and was said to pay his dues to Frank Costello, the successor to Lucky Luciano and, at the time, the most powerful Mafia leader in New York. Scarlett was an elegant Jamaican who had come out of the old Forty Thieves gang along with Bumpy. He was popular along the streets. He liked to walk into shops and pull a huge bankroll from the pocket of his tailored suit, make a small purchase with a large bill, then tell the delighted proprietor to keep the change, thus cementing his reputation for generosity&#x2014;never mind that a week later his people would be around to collect protection money from the very same store. At twenty-seven, a joyless term of military service behind him, Eddie Wesley was not known to be a scrapper. Still, he had a friend who had a friend, and before he knew it he was doing occasional odd jobs for bluff, secretive, boisterous men who were, or were not, connected to Scarlett. It was a living, Eddie told himself, but not his parents; it was only until he was discovered as a writer; besides, it would provide meat for the tales he would one day spin. He reminded himself, whenever moral doubts assailed him, that Richard Wright, in <i>Black Boy</i>, had confessed to a youthful life of crime. True, Wright stole no more than the occasional fistful of tickets from the proprietor of a movie house, and Eddie was carrying mysterious packages across state lines, but he consoled himself with Wright&#x2019;s dictum that the white man had done so many horrible things that stealing from him was no breach of ethics. And if part of him suspected that, whoever Scarlett was stealing from, it wasn&#x2019;t the white man, Eddie suppressed the thought.<br><br>&#x201c;Where do you go all these nights?&#x201d; asked Aurelia, his unattainably highborn girlfriend, whom he often wooed by reciting Andreas Cappelanus on the art of courtly love: medieval literature having been among his best courses at Amherst. They were canoodling, as it was called, in a shadowed booth at Scarlett&#x2019;s club, not the sort of place where Eddie&#x2019;s friends ever went, or, more important, Aurie&#x2019;s. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re so secretive&#x201d;&#x2014;as though she herself was not.<br><br>&#x201c;If I told you, you&#x2019;d never believe it.&#x201d;<br><br>Aurelia was much quicker than Eddie, and always had been: &#x201c;Then it can&#x2019;t possibly be another woman.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re one to talk,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d; Sipping her pink gin fizz with Kirschwasser, the drink for which she was known throughout Harlem. She was a columnist for the <i>Seventh Avenue Sentinel</i>, the second-largest Negro paper in town, and wrote about everyone&#x2019;s scandalous peccadilloes but her own. &#x201c;I am one to talk,&#x201d; she said, and leaped to her feet, tugging at his arm. &#x201c;Dance with me. Come on.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We shall be conspicuous,&#x201d; said Eddie, in the peculiar elocution he had developed at Amherst. His friends mocked him, but women adored it.<br><br>&#x201c;We shall not,&#x201d; she teased, echoing his cadences, and perhaps she was even right, because Scarlett&#x2019;s was also the sort of place that always remembered to forget you were ever there. But before they could have their dance, one of the boisterous men tugged Eddie aside for a whispered conversation. Eddie, excited, told Aurelia they would have to make it an early night, conveying through his body English what he dared not speak aloud. Alas, Aurie was not so easily impressed: included in her family tree, as she would remind you at the drop of a hat, were villains galore, as well as a Reconstruction Era congressman and the first Negro to make a million dollars in real estate.<br><br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t be involved with these people,&#x201d; Aurelia said as they walked through the sooty Harlem rain. She wore cheap plastic overshoes, but her umbrella was from Paris, where her aunt sang jazz.<br><br>&#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t involvement in the usual sense.&#x201d;<br><br>She knew his excuses, too: &#x201c;Let me guess. Research for the great novel.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Something like that.&#x201d;<br><br>They had reached the public library on 135th Street, three blocks from the apartment Aurie shared with two other women. Cars were jammed so tightly along the curb that it was a miracle they ever got out again. This was as far as Eddie was ever allowed to go. Aurelia kissed him. She had feathery eyebrows and a roundish chipmunk face. When she was happy, she looked like a playful imp. When she was earnest, the roundness hardened, and she became Hollywood&#x2019;s image of a schoolmarm. This was schoolmarm time.<br><br>&#x201c;My family has certain expectations of me,&#x201d; she began. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m an only child. My future matters to them. A lot.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So you keep telling me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because it&#x2019;s true.&#x201d; The brow crinkled. &#x201c;You know, Eddie, my uncle&#x2019;s hotel business is&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a writer.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They own hotels in seven different&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I cannot do it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He makes good money. He&#x2019;ll always make good money. I don&#x2019;t care what the Supreme Court says. We&#x2019;ll need colored hotels for the next fifty years. Maybe more.&#x201d; Eddie stroked her downy chipmunk cheek, said nothing. &#x201c;I wanted to ask you one last time, because&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>He covered her mouth. Gently. They had been arguing the point almost from the night they met, at a college mixer two months after V-J Day. Both knew the outcome in advance. &#x201c;I have to write, Aurie. The muse sits upon me. It is not a matter of choice. It is a matter of necessity.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then you should have kept the newspaper job.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It was not real writing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It was real money.&#x201d;<br><br>Later that night, as Eddie left the train station in Newark, a couple of thugs tripped him, kicked him, snatched the parcel in its neat brown paper, ran. They had marked him down weeks ago and bided their time until he got careless. He was told by one of Scarlett&#x2019;s people that the boys had admitted the crime. Not to the police. To Scarlett, who was said to have a way of loosening tongues. Eddie believed it.

Her 1981 collection of poems, A Visit to William Blake's Inn, won the Newbery Medal as that year's most distinguished contribution to American children's literature. <br> <br>Willard was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where she later received the B.A. and Ph.D. from the University of Michigan and won five Hopwood Awards for creative writing. She also studied at Stanford University, where she received her M.A.</p>In the form of a play, Willard retells the Norwegian folktale with verve, relying entirely on witty dialogue and pared-down stage directions to conjure up the world of the Troll King and his captives. Karen is the youngest daughter of a poor woodcutter, and when Bear comes to the door promising riches to her family if she will go with him, she agrees. She fails to break the spell on him--he is a prince in bearskin--and later must follow him to the Troll King's castle to rescue him. Moser provides glowing watercolor portraits of the cast, keying into Willard's modern references (telephone and TV) with his own contemporary touches: both Karen and her father are figures cut and dressed from this decade.

He had been named one of the best new chefs in America by <i>Food &amp; Wine</i> in 2002, received the James Beard Foundation Rising Star Chef of the Year Award in 2003, and in 2005 he and Nick Kokonas opened the conceptually radical restaurant Alinea, which was named Best Restaurant in America by <i>Gourmet</i> magazine. Then, positioned firmly in the world's culinary spotlight, Achatz was diagnosed with stage IV squamous cell carcinoma-tongue cancer. <br><br> The prognosis was grim, and doctors agreed the only course of action was to remove the cancerous tissue, which included his entire tongue. Desperate to preserve his quality of life, Grant undertook an alternative treatment of aggressive chemotherapy and radiation. But the choice came at a cost. Skin peeled from the inside of Grant's mouth and throat, he rapidly lost weight, and most alarmingly, he lost his sense of taste. Tapping into the discipline, passion, and focus of being a chef, Grant rarely missed a day of work. He trained his chefs to mimic his palate and learned how to cook with his other senses. As Kokonas was able to attest: The food was never better. Five months later, Grant was declared cancer-free, and just a few months following, he received the James Beard Foundation Outstanding Chef in America Award. <br><br> <i>Life, on the Line</i> tells the story of a culinary trailblazer's love affair with cooking, but it is also a book about survival, about nurturing creativity, and about profound friendship. Already much- anticipated by followers of progressive cuisine, Grant and Nick's gripping narrative is filled with stories from the world's most renowned kitchens-The French Laundry, Charlie Trotter's, el Bulli- and sure to expand the audience that made <i>Alinea</i> the number-one selling restaurant cookbook in America last year.<br><br>Watch a Video<p></p></p><p><b>Grant Achatz</b> is the owner of Alinea, Next and The Aviary in Chicago.

The book begins by teaching foundations of gesture-preparatory gestures; sustains and releases; word stress and phrase direction and basic gestures of expression-through 5 musical examples that will work effectively in small or large conducting class settings. Part 2 provides a logical and efficient approach for score study and for developing an aural image, and Part 3 presents eleven Rehearsal Practice Assignments based on repertoire included in the book to provide a thorough understanding of the rehearsal process. The carefully designed sequence of activities helps developing conductors develop rehearsal skills through progressive disclosure, which allows them to focus their attention on one detail at a time in the early assignments. As the text progresses, the assignments become more complicated. When developing conductors masters the concepts of the eleven rehearsal practice assignments, which include methods for creating sectional unisons and transparency, precise rhythm and diction, developing healthy tone, effective tools for motivation and inspiration, students will possess the ability to be extremely successful as choral conductors. KEVIN FENTON, Director of University Singers at Florida State University, is in demand as a clinician and director of honor choirs throughout the United States. He has conducted choirs in conventions of the American Choral Directors Association and Music Educators National Conference on nine occasions including University Singers&#39; performance at the 2007 ACDA convention in Miami.

To judge by his granddaughter Marina's anguished memoir, he might have found their model in the mirror.<p> In this highly impressionistic account, Marina Picasso writes of life with a man who set impassable boundaries "between the inaccessible demigod and us." And with a vengeance: Picasso terrorized his son, Marina's father, who took refuge in downward-spiraling alcoholism, his ambition crushed. "To make a dove," Picasso once wrote, "you must first wring its neck." The grandchildren fared little better; they provided Picasso only with a little local color, just as women provided him with sexual prey, and in the end everyone in her grandfather's life, Marina writes, wound up as a victim, "sacrificed to his art."</p><p> Many books have portrayed Pablo Picasso unfavorably, but this is the closest we have to a fly-on-the-wall account of the artist in his cruel prime. The picture isn't pretty, but it is captivating. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Marina Picasso is the granddaughter of Pablo Picasso. She is the founder of several charitable organizations that help underprivileged children in Vietnam.</p><h2>Doctor Who: The Mind Robber (Doctor Who Library)</h2><p>Fleeing an erupting volcano, the TARDIS enters an unknown place outside of time and space, where Doctor Who, Jamie, and Zoe encounter a fictional world</p><p>Sir Derek Jacobi won a Tony in 1985 for <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i> and was Tony-nominated in 1988 for <i>Breaking the Code.</i> His voicework includes narration for <i>The Diaries of Vaslav Nijinsky, Manor House,</i> and several <i>Doctor Who</i> titles.

It is in the necessary struggles of life, however, that we stretch our souls and gain new insights enabling us to go on.<br><br> Building on the biblical story of Jacob wrestling with God and on the story of her own battle with life-changing disappointment, Sister Joan Chittister deftly explores the landscape of suffering and hope, considering along the way such wide-ranging topics as consumerism, technology, grief, the role of women in the Catholic Church, and the events of September 11, 2001. We struggle, she says, against change, isolation, darkness, fear, powerlessness, vulnerability, exhaustion, and scarring; and while these struggles sometimes seem insurmountable, we can emerge from them with the gifts of conversion, detachment, faith, courage, surrender, limitations, endurance, transformation, and (perhaps most important) hope. Each of these struggles and gifts is discussed in a chapter of its own.<br><br> Meant to help readers cope with their own suffering and disappointment,&nbsp;<i>Scarred by Struggle, Transformed by Hope</i>&nbsp;is, in Chittister's words, "an anatomy of struggle and an account of the way hope grows in us, despite our moments of darkness, regardless of our regular bouts of depression. It is an invitation to look again at the struggles of life in order that we might remember how to recognize new life in our souls the next time our hearts turn again to clay."<br><br> Neither a self-help manual nor a book offering pat answers, but supremely practical and relevant, Chittister's&nbsp;<i>Scarred by Struggle, Transformed by Hope</i>&nbsp;will richly reward those readers seeking solace in the empathic, wise, and accessible meditations of a fellow struggler.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>Joan D. Chittister is an award-winning author and noted international lecturer, she is also the executive director of Benetvision: A Resource and Research Center for Contemporary Spirituality in Erie, Pennsylvania.A Benedictine nun reveals the great personal cost of learning humility when her order instructed her to withdraw her application to a prestigious creative writing program: She lost her dream of writing fiction. Narrating with crisp, precise diction, Chittister matches voice to mood as she talks about life being a series of lessons, a balancing act between hope and despair as life, from infancy, forges us in struggle. She animates the reading and uses the biblical story of Jacob to show how such struggles can lead to personal growth and new directions, even though they carry a cost. The cost to Jacob after wrestling with God was to limp. The cost to Chittister in learning humility was to give up her dream. This is an insightful book to savor.

When Mark and his mother travel to Venice to gather information about Mark's missing dad, Mark meets Doc Hornaday, an old family friend and masterful spinner of historical tales. As Doc describes Marco Polo's adventures&#x2014;sailing through pirate waters to where the desert begins, following the sunrise and the way of the Greek wind, crossing the broad plains and sand wastes where troves of bandits away&#x2014;Mark finds himself falling under the spell of the story that has transfixed the world for centuries. Newbery Honor winner Alan Armstrong's third novel, backed by extensive research, brings to life Marco's remarkable journey from Venice to China, where he spent seventeen years in the court of the mighty Kublai Khan.</p><p>ALAN ARMSTRONG went to China to see what Marco Polo might have seen, flying in one day the distance it took Marco three years to go by galley, camel, yak, horse, and foot, nearly at the cost of his life. Inspired by Polo's hunger for exploration and his gift for describing what he met, Armstrong wrote <i>Looking for Marco Polo,</i> his third book for children. His first book, <i>Whittington,</i> was awarded a Newbery Honor in 2006. He lives with his wife, Martha, a painter, in Massachusetts.Grade 5&#x2013;7&#x2014;This story within a story brings to life the adventures of the famed 13th-century Venetian explorer. It begins in the modern day with the disappearance of 11-year-old Mark's father, who is tracing Polo's route through the Gobi desert. Mark and his mother travel to Venice to help with the search. While there, Mark has a terrible asthma attack and meets his dad's army friend Dr. Hornaday, who decides to entertain his patient with imaginative stories about Marco Polo. His tales are full of color and excitement; the details, although they are not based on known historical events, are grounded in the author's research on Polo's times and the places he claimed to have seen. The narrative becomes a little confusing: Hornaday's dog can talk to Mark and describes what Polo's homecoming to Venice was like, as passed down through his dog ancestors. The descriptions of the world in the 13th century are fascinating, and the imagined relationship between Kublai Khan and Polo is intriguing, but due to its complicated structure, this isn't a book for reluctant readers. Illustrations are interspersed throughout. The novel is an excellent supplement for those studying the explorer and his world. Extensive chapter notes are included, but there is no map.&#x2014;<i>Caroline Tesauro, Radford Public Library, VA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Dedicated to delaying the advance of the Allies on both fronts, the Werwolf succeeded in scattered acts of sabotage and violence. By the spring of 1945, it also showed signs of becoming a vengeful Nazi reaction against the German populace itself. 'Collaborators' and 'defeatists' were frequently assassinated, and crude posters warned that certain death would follow any failure to resist the enemy. </p><p>Werwolf violence failed to mobilize a spirit of national resistance. Biddiscombe argues that the group was poorly led, armed, and organized, and that it was doomed to failure given the war-weariness of the populace and the hesitancy of young Germans to sacrifice themselves on the funeral pyre of the regime. He also demonstrates that although the group failed to assume a popular character, its influence was still great and its revolutionary sentiments would have grave implications for the future. </p><p><em>Werwolf!</em> is the most complete history to date of the Nazi partisan movement. It will be of great interest to general readers as well as to military historians.</p></p><p><b>Perry Biddiscombe</b> is an assistant professor in the Department of History at the University of Victoria.<p></p></p><h2>Starting with watercolour</h2><p>Outlines the basic techniques required to paint with watercolour.

Crumb Handbook</h2><p>This collection of original cartoons and never-before-published work takes readers on a unique journey through the life and times of one of the 20th century&#39;s most notorious and influential counter-culture artists.</p><p>From the mountains of Southern France where he currently lives and works, pop artist R. Crumb makes a grand entrance back to the publishing world with <i>The R. Crumb Handbook</i>. Part biography, part comic book, and part media critique, the latest Crumb book is a feast indeed. In addition to numerous reprints of Crumb comic hits like <i>Fritz the Cat</i> and <i>Mr. Natural</i>, the book also features new works by Crumb, including a hilarious dialogue between the artist and his wife. (Both Crumb's wife and daughter are comic book artists.) Fans already familiar with Crumb&#x2019;s comic book work will rejoice at the glossy reprints of Crumb oil paintings and sculptures, complete with gallery-owner narratives about working with the artist. There are also record covers reprints that Crumb has drawn over the years, as well as a CD of songs by the artist&#x2019;s traditional band, R. Crumb and the Cheap Suit Serenaders. But more important, the <i>Handbook</i> helps provide a window into the man himself.<p> </p><p> In fact the more you read <i>The R. Crumb Handbook</i> the more you start to understand Crumb is really a political cartoonist, challenging stereotypes, cultural norms, and the media. U.S. media in particular has had a powerful and profound impact on Crumb. Readers will learn what TV shows and books inspired Crumb, the state of comics in the 1960s versus today, the media&#x2019;s effect on day-to-day life, and what other comics served as models for Crumb in his own work. Artists like Jack Davis, John Stanley, Carl Barks, and the late Will Eisner made powerful impressions on Crumb about what comics could achieve. Crumb offers up some interesting insight into comics during the Great Depression (e.g., Dick Tracy and Superman) and explains how many of these comics mirrored the era and encouraged readers to "fight on" even during tough times. <i>The R. Crumb Handbook</i> is a solid piece of work, not only giving us a glimpse into the artist, but serving as a great read for old and new fans alike. <i>--Pat Kearney</i> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><li>Listen to an exclusive track from R.

It&#x2019;s euthanasia, embryo destruction, even infanticide&#x2014;and a potentially deadly concern with "the quality of life" of disabled people. If you think these issues don&#x2019;t concern you&#x2014;guess again. The Party of Death could be roaring into the White House, as National Review senior editor Ramesh Ponnuru shows, in the person of Hillary Rodham Clinton. </p><p>In The Party of Death, Ponnuru details how left-wing radicals, using abortion as their lever, took over the Democratic Party&#x2014;and how they have used their power to corrupt our law and politics, abolish our fundamental right to life, and push the envelope in ever more dangerous directions. In The Party of Death, Ponnuru reveals: </p><p>* How Hillary Clinton could use the abortion issue (but not in the way you think) to become president * Why the conventional wisdom about Roe v.Wade is a lie * How the party of death&#x2014;a coalition of special interests ranging from Planned Parenthood to Hollywood&#x2014;came to own the Democratic Party * How the mainstream media promotes the party of death * Why Jesse Jackson, Al Gore, and other leading liberals gave up being pro-life * How liberals use animal rights to displace human rights * The Democratic presidential candidate who said that infanticide is a mother&#x2019;s "choice" * How doctors&#x2014;and other health care professionals&#x2014;are being coerced, by law, into violating their consciences * The ultrasound revolution: why there&#x2019;s hope to stop the party of death </p><p>Ponnuru&#x2019;s shocking expos� shows just how extreme the Party of Death has become as they seek to destroy every inconvenient life, demand fealty to their radical agenda, and punish anyone who defies them. But he also shows how the tide is turning, how the Party of Death can be defeated, and why its last victim might be the Democratic Party itself.</p>Ramesh Ponnuru, senior editor at National Review, is a graduate of Princeton University and has covered politics as a reporter for more than a dozen years.

Visit her website at www.SusanWiggs.com.<br><br><em>San Francisco</em><br><br>Tess Delaney's to-do list was stacked invisibly over her head like the air traffic over O'Hare. She had clients waiting to hear from her, associates hounding her for reports and a makeor-break meeting with the owner of the firm. She pushed back at the pressing anxiety and focused on the task at hand&#x2014;restoring a treasure to its rightful owner.<br><br>The current mission brought her to an overfurnished apartment in Alamo Square. Miss Annelise Winther, still spry at eighty, ushered her into a cozy place with thready lace curtains, dust-ruffled chairs and a glorious scent of something baking. Tess wasted no time in presenting the treasure.<br><br>Miss Winther's hands, freckled by age, the joints knotted with arthritis, shook as she held the antique lavaliere. Beneath a pink knitted shawl, her bony shoulders trembled.<br><br>"This necklace belonged to my mother," she said, her voice breaking over the word. "I haven't seen it since the spring of 1941." She lifted her gaze to Tess, who sat across the scrubbed pine kitchen table from her. There were stories in the woman's eyes, winking like the facets of a jewel. "I have no words to thank you for bringing this to me."<br><br>"It's my pleasure," said Tess. "Moments like this&#x2014;they're the best part of my job." The sense of pride and accomplishment helped her ignore the insistent buzz of her phone, signaling yet another incoming message.<br><br>Annelise Winther was Tess's favorite kind of client. She was unassuming, a woman of modest means, judging by the decrepit condition of her apartment, in one of the city's rambling Victorians that had seen better days. Two cats, whom the woman had introduced as Golden and Prince, lazed in the late-afternoon autumn sunshine spilling through a bumped-out bay window. A homey-looking needlepoint piece hung on the wall, bearing the slogan Live This Day.<br><br>Miss Winther took off her glasses, polished them and put them back on. Glancing again at Tess's business card, she said, "Tess Delaney, Provenance Specialist, Sheffield Auction House. Well, Ms. Delaney. I'm extremely glad you found me, too. You've done well for yourself."<br><br>Her voice had a subtle tinge of an accent. "I saw that History Channel special about the Krakow Museum. You won an award last month in Poland."<br><br>"You saw that?" Tess asked, startled to know the woman had recognized her.<br><br>"Indeed I did. You were given a citation for restoring the rosary of Queen Maria Leszczynska. It had been stolen by Nazi looters and was missing for decades."<br><br>"It was...a moment." Tess had felt so proud that night. The only trouble was, she'd been in a room full of strangers. No one was present to witness her triumph. Her mother had promised to come but had to cancel at the last minute, so Tess had accepted the accolades in front of a small camera crew and a cultural minister with sweaty hands.<br><br>"The very second I saw your face, I knew you would be the one to find my treasure." Miss Winther's words were slightly startling. "And I'm so pleased that it's you. I specifically requested you."<br><br>"Why?"<br><br>A pause. Miss Winther's face softened. Perhaps she'd lost her train of thought. Then she said, "Because you're the best. Aren't you?"<br><br>"I try my best," Tess assured her. She thought the conversation odd, but in this business, she was accustomed to quirky clients. "This piece was with a group of recovered objects from World War II." Tess fell quiet as she thought of the other pieces&#x2014;jewelry and art and collectibles. The majority of objects remained in limbo, their original owners long gone. She tried not to imagine the terrible sense of violation so many families had suffered, with Nazis invading their homes, plundering their treasures and probably sending many of the family members off to die. Restoring lost treasures seemed a small thing, but the look on Miss Winther's face was its own reward.<br><br>"You've made a miracle happen," she declared. "I was just telling a friend on the phone that we're never too old to appreciate a true miracle."<br><br>For a miracle, Tess reflected, the task had entailed a lot of hard work. But the expression on the woman's face made all the research, travel and red tape worthwhile. At her own expense, Tess had paid an expert to meticulously clean every link, baguette and facet of the lavaliere. "This is a copy of the provenance report." She slid the document across the table. "It's basically a history of the piece from its creation to the present, as near as I could trace it to its origins in Russia."<br><br>"It's amazing that you were able to find this. When I first contacted your firm, I thought." Her voice trailed off. "How on earth did you do it?"<br><br>Working backward through the provenance report, Tess explained the progress of her research. "This piece was found with a collection of treasures seized in Copenhagen. The lavaliere is pink topaz, with gold filigree embellishments. The chain and clasp are original. It was made by a Finnish designer by the name of August Holmstrom. He was the principal jeweler for the house of Faberge."<br><br>Miss Winther's eyebrows lifted. <em>"The</em> Faberge?"<br><br>"The very one." Taking out her loupe, Tess pointed out a tiny spot on the piece. "This is Holmstrom's hallmark, right here, his initials between a double-headed Imperial eagle. He designed it specifically to foil counterfeiters. This particular piece was first mentioned in his design catalog of 1916 and produced for a fashionable shop in St. Petersburg. It was bought by a member of the Danish diplomatic corps."<br><br>"My father. He brought the necklace home from a business trip to Russia, and my mother was seldom without it. Besides her wedding ring, it was her favorite piece ofjewelry. He gave it to her to celebrate my birth. Though she never said so, I suspect she couldn't have more children after me." Her eyes took on a faraway look, and Tess wondered what she was seeing&#x2014;her handsome father? Her mother, wearing the jewel against her heart?<br><br>The stories behind the treasures were always so intriguing, though often bittersweet. The sad ones were particularly hard to bear. There were some cruelties that were simply inconceivable to normal people, some injustices too big to grasp. Miss Winther must have been tiny when her world was ripped apart. How scared she must have been, how confused.<br><br>"I wish I could do more than simply restore this object," said Tess. "It wound up with a number of other pieces in a repository in the basement of an abandoned government building. I spent the past year researching the archives. The Gestapo claimed they kept objects for safekeeping. It was a common ploy. The one helpful thing they did was to keep meticulous records of the things they seized."<br><br>Here was where things got dicey. How much information did Miss Winther really need? Did she have to know what had likely happened to her parents?<br><br>There were facts Tess had no intention of sharing, such as the evidence that Hilde Winther had been seized without authority by a corrupt officer, and probably treated like a sex slave for months before she was put to death. This was the trouble with uncovering the mysteries of the past. Sometimes you ended up discovering things better left buried. Was it preferable to expose the truth at any cost or to protect someone from troubling matters they had no power to change?<br><br>"This piece was taken from your mother after she was arrested on suspicion of hiding spies, saboteurs and resistance fighters at Bispebjerg Hospital. According to the arrest report, she was accused of pretending her patients were extremely ill, and she would tend to them until they conveniently disappeared."<br><br>Miss Winther caught her breath, then nodded. "That sounds like Mama. She was so very brave. She told me she was a hospital volunteer, but I always knew she was doing something important." Behind her spectacles, the old lady's eyes took on a cold glaze of anger. "My mother was dragged away on a beautiful spring afternoon while I watched."<br><br>Tess felt an unbidden shudder of sympathy for the little girl Miss Winther had once been. "I'm so sorry. No child should have to witness that."<br><br>Miss Winther held out the necklace, the facets of the large pink topaz catching the light. "Could you...put it on me?" she asked.<br><br>"Of course." Tess came around behind her and fastened the clasp of the necklace, feeling the old woman's delicate bone structure. Her hair smelled of lavender, and her dress under the pink shawl was threadbare and faded. Tess felt a surge of emotion. This find was going to change Miss Winther's life. In a single transaction, the old woman could find herself living in the lap of luxury.<br><br>Miss Winther reached up, cradling the jewel between her palms. "She was wearing it that day. Even as they were taking her away, she ordered me to run for my life, and that is just what I did. I was very lucky in that moment, or perhaps there had been a tip-off. A boy who was with the Holger Danske&#x2014;the Danish resistance&#x2014;spirited me to safety. Such a hero he was, like the Scarlet Pimpernel in the French Revolution, only he was quite real. I wouldn't be here today if not for him. None of us would."<br><br><em>None of us...?</em> Tess wondered who she was referring to. Ghosts from the woman's sad past, probably. She didn't ask, though; she had other appointments on her schedule and couldn't spare the time. And knowing the human cost of the tragedy made Tess feel vulnerable. Still, she was taken by the old lady's sweetness and the air of nostalgia that softened her features when she touched the reclaimed treasure around her neck.<br><br><em>We're both all alone, we two,</em> thought Tess. Had Miss Winther always been alone? <em>Will I always be?</em><br><br>"Well, I'm certainly glad you're here." The old lady's smile was soft and strangely intimate.<br><br>"This is the appraisal on the piece. I think you'll be very pleased."<br><br>The old lady stared at the document. "It says my mother's la-valiere is worth $800,000."<br><br>"It's an estimate. Depending on how the bidding goes, it could vary by about ten percent up or down."<br><br>Miss Winther fanned herself. "That's a fortune," she said. "It's more money than I ever dreamed of having."<br><br>"And not nearly enough to replace your loss, but it's quite a find. I'm really happy for you." Tess felt a glow of accomplishment and pleasure for Miss Winther. In her frayed shawl, surrounded by old things, she didn't look like a wealthy woman, but soon, she would be.<br><br>All the painstaking work of restitution had led to this moment. Tess spread a multipage contract on the table. "Here's the agreement with Sheffield Auction House, my firm. It's standard, but you'll want to go over it with a contracts expert."<br><br>A timer dinged, and Miss Winther got up from the table. "The scones are ready. My favorites&#x2014;I make them with lavender sugar. It's an old Danish recipe for autumn. You sit tight, dear, and I'll fix the tea."<br><br>Tess pressed her teeth together and tried not to seem impatient, though she had more appointments and work to do at the office. Honestly, she didn't want a scone, with or without lavender sugar. She didn't want tea. Coffee and a cigarette were more to her taste and definitely more suited to the pace of her life. She'd been running since she'd rocketed out of grad school five years before, and she was in a hurry now. The quicker she brought the signed agreement to her firm, the quicker she earned her bonus and could move on to the next transaction.<br><br>However, the nature of her profession often called for forbearance. People became attached to their things, and sometimes letting go took time. Miss Winther had gone to a lot of trouble to make scones. Knowing what she knew about the Winther family, Tess wondered what the woman felt when she reminisced about the old days&#x2014;fear and privation? Or happier times, when her family had been intact?<br><br>As she bustled around her old-fashioned kitchen, Miss Win-ther would pause every so often in front of a little framed mirror by the door, gazing at the necklace with a faraway look in her eyes. Tess wondered what she saw there&#x2014;her pretty, adored mother? An innocent girl who had no idea her entire world was about to be snatched away?<br><br>"Tell me about what you do," Miss Winther urged her, pouring tea into a pair of china cups. "I would love to hear about your life."<br><br>"I guess you could say finding treasure is in my blood."<br><br>Miss Winther gave a soft gasp, as though Tess's statement surprised her. "Really?"<br><br>"My mother is a museum acquisitions expert. My grandmother had an antiques salon in Dublin."<br><br>"So you come from a line of independent women."<br><br>Nicely put, thought Tess. Her gaze skated away. She wasn't one to chat up a client for the sake of making a deal, but she genuinely liked Miss Winther, perhaps because the woman seemed truly interested in her. "Neither my mother nor my grandmother ever married," she explained. "I'll probably carry on that tradition, as well. My life is too busy for a serious relationship." <em>Gah, Tess, listen to yourself,</em> she thought. <em>Say it often enough and you'll believe it.</em><br><br>"Well. I suspect that's only because the right person hasn't come along...yet. Pretty girl like you, with all that gorgeous red hair. I'm surprised some man hasn't swept you off your feet."<br><br>Tess shook her head. "My feet are planted firmly on the ground."<br><br>"I never married, either." A wistful expression misted her eyes. "I was in love with a man right after the war, but he married someone else." She paused to admire the stone once again. "It must be so exciting, the work of a treasure hunter."<br><br>"It takes a lot of research, which most people would find tedious. So many dead ends and disappointments," said Tess. "Most of my time is spent combing archives and old records and catalogs. It can be frustrating. But so worthwhile when I get to make a restitution like this. And every once in a great while, I might find myself peeling away a worthless canvas to find a Ver-meer beneath. Or unearthing a fortune under a shepherd's hut in a field somewhere. Sometimes it's a bit macabre. The plunder might be stashed in a casket."<br><br>Miss Winther shuddered. "That's ghoulish."<br><br>"When people have something to hide, they tend to put it where no one would want to look. Your piece wasn't stored in a dramatic hiding place. It was tagged and neatly cataloged, along with dozens of other illegally seized pieces."<br><br>Miss Winther arranged the scones just so with a crisp linen napkin in a basket, and brought them to the table.<br><br>Tess took a warm scone, just to be polite.<br><br>"It sounds as though you like your work," Miss Winther said.<br><br>"Very much. It's everything to me." As she said the words aloud, Tess felt a wave of excitement. The business was fast-paced and unpredictable, and each day might bring an adrenaline rush&#x2014;or crushing disappointment. Tess was having a banner year; her accomplishments were bringing her closer to the things she craved like air and water&#x2014;recognition and security.<br><br>"That sounds just wonderful. I'm certain you'll get exactly what you're looking for."<br><br>"In this business, I'm not always sure what that is." Tess sneaked another glance at the clock on the stove.<br><br></p><h2>Audubon&#39;s masterpieces: 150 prints from the Birds of America</h2><p>150 Prints from the birds of America!</p><p>John James Audubon (April 26, 1785 ?

He didn&#x2019;t know that the one small simple-looking engraving tool could eventually save them. Or get them killed. All he knew, in the beginning, was that the burin was impossible to use precisely, and that he was not naturally suited for metal, the way he&#x2019;d always been for canvas.</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t like the way it felt in his hand either. Oddly heavy, hard to maneuver. He felt it should create lines with the agility of a brush, or even charcoal, and yet his hand kept getting stuck, and he became repeatedly frustrated at his inability to achieve the perfect lines and grooves in the metal the way Frederick showed him. He worried that Frederick would fire him as his apprentice, and then he would have to find not only another job, but also another place to live. As Frederick&#x2019;s apprentice, Kristoff had been receiving room and board with the Faber family in their beautiful home on the out- skirts of Grotsburg, as well as five schilling a week. But most important, the opportunity to learn the trade that Frederick Faber was known for throughout Austria: engraving. His greatest creation was the country&#x2019;s most popular&#x2014;and, Kristoff would argue, artistically perfect&#x2014;postage stamp, the 12 Groschen Edelweiss. The stamp was a stunning replica of the pure white f lower, and Frederick had both designed and engraved it himself in 1932.</p><p>Kristoff remembered placing that stamp on a letter he&#x2019;d written to his mother once, but had never sent. He could not mail a letter to someone who didn&#x2019;t exist, or whose existence and location he could never determine in spite of his best efforts. But even as a young boy of thirteen, Kristoff had admired the artistry of that stamp, the perfect bows of the petals. He&#x2019;d always wanted to make a living as an artist. So when he&#x2019;d heard the rumor last fall from another street artist in Vienna, that Frederick Faber,&nbsp;<i>the&nbsp;</i>Frederick Faber, was searching for a new apprentice, Kristoff had packed up his art supplies and spent most of his small savings to hire a ride to take him the two hundred kilometers out to Grotsburg. And when he&#x2019;d arrived, he&#x2019;d convinced Frederick to give him the job after he showed Frederick some of his charcoal sketches of Vienna.</p><p>&#x201c;You have a good eye,&#x201d; Frederick had said, staring at what Kristoff thought was his most noteworthy sketch: Stephansdom, elaborate in all its detail of the two wide turrets in the front. Frederick had raised a thick gray eyebrow. &#x201c;But what do you know of metal, my boy?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a quick learner,&#x201d; Kristoff had promised, and that had seemed enough to convince Frederick to take him on. Though, so far, this had turned out not to be true, at least where engraving was concerned.</p><p>Though he didn&#x2019;t master the burin right away, Kristoff did learn two things in his first few weeks working for Frederick. One, Frederick was older than Kristoff had initially thought, and sometimes his hands began to shake when he tried to teach Kristoff how to use the engraving tools. Frederick had told Kristoff he needed an apprentice because there was business enough for two master engravers to work on his stamp assignments for Austria, but now Kristoff suspected the real reason was that Frederick might not be able to continue on with his trade much longer. And Frederick didn&#x2019;t have any sons.</p><p>That was the second thing Kristoff learned. Frederick had two daughters: Elena, who was seventeen, a year younger than Kristoff, and who reminded Kristoff of the edelweiss with her snowy skin, waves of long light brown hair, and bright green eyes. And Miriam, who was thirteen. If Elena was a flower, then Miriam was the buzzing bee who wouldn&#x2019;t leave the flower alone. Or, as Mrs. Faber called her with an exasperated roll of her green eyes, a&nbsp;<i>flibbertigibbet</i>. But Kristoff still found her amusing, even when her family did not.</p><p>Kristoff quickly became accustomed to life in Grotsburg, where the world was green and very quiet, and instead of buildings and throngs of people, he woke up each morning to a view of the forest and rolling hills. But even more, Kristoff reveled in the warmth of the Fabers&#x2019; dining room, of the fragrant smell of Mrs. Faber&#x2019;s stews, of the bread they broke on Friday nights in the glow of their candles. The challah was a savory bread, and Kristoff had never tasted anything like it growing up in the orphanage in Vienna, where the nuns had led him to believe there was only one religion anyway. Not that he was necessarily a believer. Kristoff was much more drawn to the Fabers, the light and wholeness of their family, than he had ever been to God or the institutional church.</p><p>&#x201c;Miriam, sit still,&#x201d; Mrs. Faber chastised, one night a few weeks after Kristoff had begun his apprenticeship. Almost a month in, Kristoff was still failing miserably at the metalwork. Though earlier that day he had impressed Frederick with his sketch of the hillside, and even hours later, he was still basking in Frederick&#x2019;s compliment that it was &#x201c;not half bad.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sitting still, Mother,&#x201d; Miriam said in a singsong voice, bouncing slightly in her chair and casting a sideways smile at Kristoff.</p><p>Kristoff hid his own smile in his spoonful of soup. He glanced at Elena, but she refused to look at him. He had yet to determine whether she was shy or rude, whether she acted so standoffish around everyone, or whether it was just around him.</p><p>&#x201c;Elena, dear. Go fetch another log or two for the fire. It&#x2019;s chilly in here,&#x201d; Mrs. Faber said. It was the deepest, coldest part of winter, and the Faber&#x2019;s three-story wooden house was drafty. Kristoff &#x2019;s room in the attic had a small woodstove, but he had to huddle under two blankets to stay warm at night. Still, it far surpassed the orphanage, his bed in a row of ten others in a large cold room, and only a thin blanket to cover him. And Mrs. Faber&#x2019;s cooking was much better than the nuns&#x2019;.</p><p>Elena put her soup spoon down and stood. Kristoff tried to meet her eyes again, but she wouldn&#x2019;t look up.</p><p>&#x201c;I can help.&#x201d; Kristoff stood, before he lost his nerve, and Elena turned toward him. At least he&#x2019;d caught her attention.</p><p>Her beautiful face sunk into a frown. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not&#x2014;&#x201d; she began.</p><p>Mrs. Faber spoke over her: &#x201c;Thank you, Kristoff. I&#x2019;m sure Elena would appreciate that.&#x201d;</p><p>He smiled at Mrs. Faber and followed Elena. They went wordlessly through the kitchen, out the back door, toward the woodpile, which rested across the Fabers&#x2019; sprawling yard in front of Frederick&#x2019;s workshop. The earth was frozen, and the ground crunched beneath their feet; the night air was biting and neither Kristoff nor Elena had grabbed a coat. Elena shivered, and her hair fell into her eyes as she reached down to grab the wood. Kristoff resisted the urge to pull it back, and instead reached down and took the log from her hands.</p><p>&#x201c;Really,&#x201d; she said sharply, pulling it back and holding it toward her chest. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just fine. I&#x2019;ve been doing this on my own long before you came here. I don&#x2019;t need your help.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But I want to help,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And it&#x2019;s no trouble.&#x201d; Elena glared, and he was suddenly certain that she was not shy&#x2014;she just didn&#x2019;t like him. And this realization bothered him. He had the urge to fix it.</p><p>But before he could say more, Elena turned and began to walk back toward the house. Kristoff picked up another log from the pile and ran after her. He caught her just before they reached the back door, and he reached for her shoulder. &#x201c;Have I done something?&#x201d; he asked her, slightly out of breath from running in the cold. His words came out jagged and smoky against the chilly air.</p><p>&#x201c;Something?&#x201d; she echoed back.</p><p>&#x201c;To upset you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why should you think that?&#x201d; Her breath made frosty rings in the air, and she shivered again.</p><p>&#x201c;Never mind,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We should get back inside. You&#x2019;re freezing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Look,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that we&#x2019;re not friends, okay. We&#x2019;re not going to be friends. I don&#x2019;t expect you to be here long. They never are.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They?&#x201d; he asked, considering, for the first time, Frederick&#x2019;s last apprentice, or maybe his last few? Were they all terrible with the burin, like him, and promptly fired?</p><p>But Elena didn&#x2019;t answer. She carried the wood inside and placed it into the fire. Kristoff did the same, and then he excused himself to go to bed. Up in the attic, wrapped in two blankets, he took out his sketch pad and a nib of charcoal. He found himself sketching Elena&#x2019;s angry green eyes and wondering how long this place would stay his home.</p></p><h2>Kare Kano: His and Her Circumstances, Vol. 5</h2><p>After Soichiro threatens Yukino&#39;s status as most popular, Yukino tries to regain her idol-like popularity, struggling with her own inner problems while they develop a unique relationship.</p><p></p><h2>MARKING TIME (The Cazalet Chronicle, Vol. 2)</h2><p>As England braces itself for war, Clary Cazalet withdraws into her books and journals, sweet-tempered Polly Cazalet agonizes over a secret illness in the family, and Louise Cazalet returns to boarding school.</p><p>Elizabeth Jane Howard was the author of fifteen highly acclaimed novels. The Cazalet Chronicles - The Light Years, Marking Time, Confusion, Casting Off and All Change - have become established as modern classics and have been adapted for a major BBC television series and for BBC Radio 4. In 2002 Macmillan published Elizabeth Jane Howard&#39;s autobiography, Slipstream. In that same year she was awarded a CBE in the Queen&#39;s Birthday Honours List. She died, aged ninety, at home in Suffolk on 2 January 2014.A perfect if inauspicious title for this second course of Howard's Cazalet Chronicles (begun with The Light Years, 1990), since this latest is all idling before something big happens--as the Cazalet writer-to-be, Clary, puts it, ``We need people to be in love with....We'll just have to wait.'' The waiting begins right after Chamberlain's ``peace with honor'' falls through and Hitler marches into Poland. At the Sussex manse of ``Brig'' Cazalet--now a blind old duffer shepherded around by his faithful spinster daughter, Rachel--the much extended Cazalet family gathers with their gas masks, not to mention orphaned babies (one of Rachel's charity), wounded soldiers, and London evacuees. The Brig's eldest son, Hugh, lamed during the Great War, stays at home to blunder along with the family timber firm and to coddle his wife, Sybil, who has incurable cancer; middle son, Edward, the womanizer, joins up, spending weekend leaves sexually abusing his beautifully budding daughter, Louise, while his wife, Villy, develops a crush on a conductor; and the last son, Rupert, goes missing in action right before his young wife, Zoe, has a baby. In addition, Howard focuses on the children of this crew, including: 17-year-old Louise, who attends acting school; Clary, Rupert's daughter by his late first wife, who nicely copes with her airheaded stepmother and fills her journal feverishly; and Polly, whose chief attribute is her goodness. By the end, Japan has drawn the US into the war; there's word of Rupert, possible romance for Clary, and as always, the Cazalets marching ever on.

Mole also meets Ratty&#x2019;s good friends: the kindly, solid Badger and the irrepressible Toad.

Such is the cautious, agreeable Mole's first introduction to the river and the Life Adventurous. Emerging from his home at Mole End one spring, his whole world changes when he hooks up with the good-natured, boat-loving Water Rat, the boastful Toad of Toad Hall, the society- hating Badger who lives in the frightening Wild Wood, and countless other mostly well-meaning creatures. Michael Hague's exquisitely detailed, breathtaking color illustrations on almost every generous spread--along with Kenneth Grahame's elegant, delightfully old-fashioned characterizations of the animals--make this book a wonderful read-aloud. Grahame's <i>The Wind in the Willows</i> has enchanted readers for four generations, and this lavishly illustrated gift edition is perhaps the finest around. <i>(All ages, or 9 to 12)</i> <p>This reviews refers to ISBN 0805002138.</p>7 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>An omelette and a glass of wine</h2><p>An Omelette and a Glass of Wine</p><p><i>An Omelette and a Glass of Wine</i>, by Elizabeth David, is one of the first books that the Lyons Press (formerly Lyons and Burford) published as part of the Cook's Classic Library series. It offers 62 articles written by David between 1955 and 1984 for a variety of publications. Many of these pieces, such as "I'll Be with You in the Squeezing of a Lemon," from 1969--about cooking with lemons--barely show their age. But even if they did, you wouldn't care, because of the rich store of information that David shares and the literary grace with which she imparts it. <p> "Foods of Legend" is a choice example. This essay is astonishingly timely in its discourse on a chef feeling compelled to elevate a humble country dish into haute cuisine. David bases her story on Master Chef August Escoffier's recomposition, over a century ago, of a Proven�al favorite: potatoes baked with artichokes onto Carr� d'Agneau Mistral, which involved adding truffles and rack of lamb. </p><p> Some articles include recipes, but for the most part this is a volume nicely sized to curl up with or to take on a trip.</p>An Omelette and a Glass of Wine, a collection of articles originally written for The Spectator, Gourmet magazine, Vogue, and The (London) Sunday Times, among others, is the penultimate book by Elizabeth David. This revered classic volume contains delightful explorations of food and cooking, among which are the collection's namesake essay and other such gems as "Syllabubs and Fruit Fools," "Sweet Vegetables, Soft Wine," "Pleasing Cheeses," and "Whisky in the Kitchen." Her many admirers will cherish this new edition, and readers coming to know Ms. David for the first time will marvel at her wisdom and grace. <br></p><h2>The Cry of the Halidon: A Novel</h2><p>Alex McAuliff has received an offer he can&#x2019;t refuse: two million dollars for a geological survey of Jamaica.

But British Intelligence is aware of the deal, and they&#x2019;ve let Alex in on a secret of their own: The last survey team Dunstone dispatched to Jamaica vanished without a trace.

In so doing, he not only tells a remarkable tale, but he compels us all, even those obsessed solely with contemporary military affairs, to ask the right questions and to distinguish what is truly new and revolutionary from what is merely ephemeral.

In rural Oregon, Gemma LaPorte wakes up in a hospital with a fragmented memory. Det. Will Tanninger tells Gemma that she's a prime suspect in a hit and run that critically injured a child molester. As Gemma's memories start to return and she finds notes she had made about brain function, she wonders whether the concussion is the only reason for her amnesia.

In Meissner's uneven second novel, eight-year-old Megan Diamond's best friend, Jen Lovett, is snatched by strangers as they ride bikes in their San Diego neighborhood. Meissner (<i>Why the Sky Is Blue</i>) chronicles the events leading up to Jen's disappearance and the ripple effects of the kidnapping, which will affect Megan's self-confidence, perception of romantic love and trust in God through adulthood. Jen's unexpected reappearance years later&#x2014;just as her father makes headlines as one of the richest men in America&#x2014;is disappointingly anticlimactic. Meissner tells rather than shows and overexplains some of her potentially lovely symbolism rather than letting readers draw their own conclusions. But her characters are vivid creations, and there are good intergenerational moments between Megan and an elderly furniture upholsterer. Megan's early platonic relationship with the home-schooled and ultra-polite David Christopoulos will play well with conservative Christian readers, as will Megan's assertion, "I don't want to live in a world like this one without God." However, the story never quite takes off, and the ending will feel abrupt to many readers.&nbsp;<br> Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It is the distillation of what the Pardey&#39;s have learned in 150,000 miles of sailing on board their two cutters, Seraffyn and Taleisin, and on scores of other boats they have delivered or raced. Lin and Larry tell how they have sailed in comfort and safety without large cash outlay- on a pay-as-you-earn-as-you-go plan and by simplifying.In its first edition, this invaluable text has seen nine reprints. Now Lin and Larry have updated and revised the information to make it current and a valuable edition to any sailor&#39;s library right up to the millennium.</p><p>Lin and Larry Pardey have voyaged together for over 26 years, covering the equivalent of 5 circumnavigations on board their own self-built cutters, Seraffyn and Taleisin. Larry worked as first mate on a 140-ton, 85-foot schooner, Double Eagle, voyaging from Newport Beach, California, to Hawaii and back and along the Mexican coast before meeting Lin. He, along with Leslie Dyball, won the handicap prize for first overall in the exceptionally stormy 1974 Round Britain two-handed race. Lin and Larry have delivered two dozen boats across oceans and raced their own and others boats. Their interest in storm tactics has led them to research both older and modern methods of heaving-to, by talking and corresponding with sailors from dozens of countries, by working with Victor Shane at the Drag Device Data Base, and by testing both on their own boat in hurricane-force winds and on modern boats off the Cape of Storms, in South Africa. <p>Larry was selected as the winner of the International Oceanic Award, givenby the Royal Institute of Navigation under the sponsorship of the Little Ship Club of London and presented by Her Royal Highness, the Princess Royal, Princess Anne, for the most meritorious voyage of over 2,000 miles using traditional methods of navigation. Larrys award was for 30 years of successful voyaging, covering more than 150,000 miles on 21 different vessels and using onlysextant and chronometer, including his 2,840 mile voyage in 1995 from Fernancdo do Noronha to Horta, in the Azores. </p><p>In March 1996, Lin was presented with the Ocean Cruising Club Award for the person who has done the most to foster and encourage ocean cruising in small craft and the practice of seamanship and navigation in all branches, at the Royal Thames Yacht Club, in London. </p><p>Articles by Lin and Larry have appeared in <i>Sail Magazine</i>, <i>Cruising World</i>, <i>Woodenboat</i> (USA) <i>Practical Boat Owner</i>, <i>Yachting Monthly</i>, <i>Classic Boat Magazine</i> (UK), <i>Cruising Helmsman</i> (Australia), <i>South African Yachting</i>, and <i>Nautica</i> (Brazil). </p><p>Their nine books have been published in both the United States and England; two have been translated into German and Japanese. Lin and Larry are currently writing a new book, <i>The Cost Conscious Cruiser</i>. Their most recent voyage took them to Scotland and Norway, and Taleisin is ready for another voyage, either west or north in the spring of 1998.</p>The Pardeys have voyaged more than 170,000 miles, including both east-about/west-about circumnavigations and have made passages on 20 different boats, ranging in size from self-built 24&#39; 4&#34; and 29&#39; 6&#34; cutters through modern racing boats to 85-foot classic schooners.

I&#x2019;ve been a member of some the most friendly and well-run groups you could ever imagine &#x2013; the State Revenue Society and the American Philatelic Society are both examples of best practice &#x2013; and I even flirted briefly with philatelic exhibiting. Despite having served such a lengthy apprenticeship I still don&#x2019;t have an answer to a really basic question: "Why are postage stamps catalogued, collected and researched with so much more energy and enthusiasm than revenue stamps?" There are many countries where there doesn&#x2019;t seems to be a reliable and up-to-date catalogue of revenue stamps &#x2013; certainly not one accessible to a virtual monoglot such as myself. I think it comes down to what I call &#x201c;critical mass&#x201d;. Without enough revenue stamp collectors it is hard for dealers to establish a viable business but without dealers generating catalogues and generally raising the profile of this branch of the hobby I suspect that prospective revenue stamp collectors tend to wander off into the sunset searching for easier pickings. The Revenue Society has defined revenue stamps as " ...stamps, whether impressed, adhesive or otherwise, issued by or on behalf of International, National or Local Governments, their Licensees or Agents, and indicate that a tax, duty or fee has been paid or prepaid or that permission has been granted." This small study is intended to bring to the attention of the collecting public the sheer diversity of revenue stamps.</p><p>Martin Nicholson (born 1954 in Westminster, London) was educated at St Albans School in Hertfordshire and Nottingham University. After a brief spell working in the food industry Martin became a college lecturer based in Somerset and later in Northamptonshire. Although he had a successful career as a teacher he is probably best known for the 25 years+ he served as a school governor and for the ground-breaking work he carried out in the fields of amateur astronomy and postal history.</p><h2>Woodswoman III: Book Three of the Woodswoman&#39;s Adventures</h2><p>All three of Dr. Bastille&#39;s books are adventures in the North Woods, however, this one clearly shows how her writing has matured with her own experiences. With harsher stories of vandals, environmental scoundrels and the personal tragedies, she seems to counter it all with great stories of bravery, incredible friendships and profound people. She still endears the reader with magical stories of the woods, lakes and mountains. Marking her third decade living in the Adirondack wilderness, Dr. LaBastille&#39;s writing is more realistic, world-wary and sometimes achingly mature. Facing aging, near helplessness at the pollution and noise on wilderness lakes, she still keeps her sense of humor with great dignity. A gracious gift or a book for your collection; she shares her life of passion.

He lives in Bozeman, Montana.Grade 6-8-- Out hunting, 13-year-old Josh watches in horror as his drunk father illegally shoots a mother bear, orphaning its cub. To prevent it from being seized (and probably destroyed) by the authorities, the boy heads for the mountains on his deceased brother's motorcycle with the cub and his dog, leaving a note that he won't return until there's a state law to protect the bears. His experiences alternate with the tense efforts of dedicated search and rescue teams to find him. Many people become involved in his mission and survival, from the governor to citizens who support Josh's crusade. The relationship between his parents, idyllic before the death of his brother and now jeopardized by his father's alcoholism, is sensitively wrought; however, the portrait of the fish-and-game administrator defending the rights of the hunter is darkly villainous, especially in comparison with the heroic environmental types. Because the length of the book may put off some readers, entice them with the jacket photo of the author with his 500-pound black bear. --Susan F.

Jacobs doesn't want you to twist your body in a knot; he just wants to help you hit the ball where you want it to go. To that end, he provides 25 "Lessons" to address specific problems and presents sound advice for eight specific "Situations." Say your shots generally start out straight but soon veer off drastically to the right--the golfer's malady called the slice. Find the appropriate diagnosis to fit the disease. (In this case it's right up front in Lesson One.) Jacobs first gives a concise description of the problem, follows with a clear, illustrated explanation of what's going wrong (the clubface is open at impact), and finally guides you through an illustrated correction. It couldn't be easier, and the 25 faults he applies cover all aspects of the game. The Situations are set up just as simply. Say you're driving onto a hole that has hazards on the right. He prescribes several possible preventive measures for staying out of trouble. Other Situations deal with crosswinds, tight lies, and sloping terrain. As with the Lessons, all come with illustrated suggestions, dispensed in doses that are manageable in size yet potent enough to have immediate impact on the particular disorder. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i>From tee to green, learn how to quickly cure your swing of the most common faults.John Jacobs, author of the classic Practical Golf, has been called "a great golf teacher" by Jack Nicklaus. In Golf Doctor, he uses his renowned knowledge of the swing to help you identify and correct the twenty-five most common problems that bedevil golfers. Using the flight of the ball as the essential indicator - you have a problem with topping the ball to your right, for instance - you can turn to a clear, concise, and simple lesson that explains the fault and how to banish it forever from your swing.With this master teacher's guidance, you will know what is going wrong and what must be done to correct these and other typical mistakes: shots start on line but then curve to the right, especially with woods and longer irons; shots are frequently topped to the left, while others start left, then slice right on a low trajectory; pitch shots fly on a straight line but to the left of the target, those that do not fly straight are often unusually high and finish well short of the hole; bunker shots are inconsistent, with the ball staying in the sand or flying over the green; putting is generally poor, with longer attempts rarely having the correct distance.Jacobs provides invaluable tips and advice on avoiding wasted strokes, adding length to shots from the rough, playing in crosswinds, and shaping shots around a tree or brush; he also offers insights into getting the most out of your practice and playing with the best attitude for success.Practical and easy to follow, Golf Doctor teaches you to help yourself so that you soon will be striking the ball solidly and consistently. It is almost as good as having your own private instructor.

By the authors of Relic. 100,000 first printing.</p><p>Douglas Preston, who worked for several years in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, is the author of the acclaimed nonfiction works Dinosaurs in the Attic and Cities of Gold, and the novel, Jennie. He lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico.<br><br>Lincoln Child has collected and edited numerous ghost and horror story anthologies, including Dark Company and Dark Banquet. Formerly a trade editor with St. Martin&#x2019;s Press in New York City, he now lives in Morristown, New Jersey.Guy Carson, stuck at yet another traffic light, glanced at the clock on his dashboard. He was already late for work, second time this week. Ahead, U.S. Route 1 ran like a bad dream through Edison, New Jersey. The light turned green, but by the time he had edged up it was red again.<br>&#x201c;Son of a <i>bitch</i>&#x201d; he muttered, slamming the dashboard with the fat part of his palm. He watched as the rain splattered across the windshield, listened to the slap and whine of the wipers. The serried ranks of brake lights rippled back toward him as the traffic slowed yet again. He knew he&#x2019;d never get used to this congestion any more than he&#x2019;d get used to all the damn rain.<br>Creeping painfully over a rise, Carson could see, a mere half mile down the highway, the crisp white facade of the GeneDyne Edison complex, a postmodern masterpiece rising above green lawns and artificial ponds. Somewhere inside, Fred Peck lay in wait.<br>Carson turned on the radio, and the throbbing sound of the Gangsta Muthas filled the air. As he fiddled with the dial, Michael Jackson&#x2019;s shrill voice separated itself from the static. Carson punched it off in disgust. Some things were even worse than the thought of Peck. Why couldn&#x2019;t they have a decent country station in this hole?<br>* * *<br>The lab was bustling when he arrived, Peck nowhere in sight. Carson drew the lab coat over his lanky frame and sat down at his terminal, knowing his log-on time would automatically go into his personnel file. If by some miracle Peck was out sick, he&#x2019;d be sure to notice when he came in. Unless he had died, of course. Now, that was something to think about. The man did look like a walking heart attack.<br>&#x201c;Ah, Mr. Carson,&#x201d; came the mocking voice behind him. &#x201c;How kind of you to grace us with your presence this morning.&#x201d; Carson closed his eyes and took a deep breath, then turned around.<br>The soft form of his supervisor was haloed by the fluorescent light. Peck&#x2019;s brown tie still bore testament to that morning&#x2019;s scrambled eggs, and his generous jowls were mottled with razor burn. Carson exhaled through his nose, fighting a losing battle with the heavy aroma of Old Spice.<br>It had been a shock on Carson&#x2019;s first day at GeneDyne, one of the world&#x2019;s premier biotechnology companies, to find a man like Fred Peck there waiting for him. In the eighteen months since, Peck had gone out of his way to keep Carson busy with menial lab work. Carson guessed it had something to do with Peck&#x2019;s lowly M.S. from Syracuse University and his own Ph.D. from MIT. Or maybe Peck just didn&#x2019;t like Southwestern hicks.<br>&#x201c;Sorry I&#x2019;m late,&#x201d; he said with what he hoped would pass for sincerity. &#x201c;Got caught in traffic.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Traffic,&#x201d; said Peck, as if the word was new to him.<br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Carson, &#x201c;they&#x2019;ve been rerouting&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Re<i>routin</i>&#x2019;,&#x201d; Peck repeated, imitating Carson&#x2019;s Western twang.<br>&#x201c;&#x2014;detouring, I mean, the traffic from the Jersey Turn-pike&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ah, the <i>Turnpike</i>,&#x201d; Peck said.<br>Carson fell silent.<br>Peck cleared his throat. &#x201c;traffic in New Jersey at rush hour. What an unexpected shock it must have been for you, Carson.&#x201d; He crossed his arms. &#x201c;You almost missed your meeting.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Meeting?&#x201d; Carson said. &#x201c;What meeting? I didn&#x2019;t know&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course you didn&#x2019;t know. I just heard about it myself. That&#x2019;s one of the many reasons you have to be here on time, Carson.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, Mr. Peck,&#x201d; Carson said, getting up and following Peck past a maze of identical cubicles. Mr. Fred Peckerwood. Sir Frederick Peckerfat. He was itching to deck the oily bastard. But that wasn&#x2019;t the way they did business around here. If Peck had been a ranch boss, the man would&#x2019;ve been on his ass in the dirt long ago.<br>Peck opened a door marked videoconferencing room ii and waved Carson inside. It was only as Carson looked around the large, empty table within that he realized he was still wearing his filthy lab coat.<br>&#x201c;Take a seat,&#x201d; Peck said.<br>&#x201c;Where is everybody?&#x201d; Carson asked.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just you,&#x201d; Peck replied. He started to back out the door.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not staying?&#x201d; Carson felt a rising uncertainty, wondering if he&#x2019;d missed an important piece of e-mail, if he should have prepared something. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s this about, anyway?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I have no idea,&#x201d; Peck replied. &#x201c;Carson, when you&#x2019;re finished here, come straight down to my office. We need to talk about your attitude.&#x201d;<br>The door shut with the solid click of oak engaging steel. Carson gingerly took a seat at the cherrywood table and looked around. It was a beautiful room, finished in hand-rubbed blond wood. A wall of windows looked out over the meadows and ponds of the GeneDyne complex. Beyond lay endless urban waste. Carson tried to compose himself for whatever ordeal was coming. Probably Peck had sent in enough negative ratings on him to merit a stem lecture from personnel, or worse.<br>In a way, he supposed, Peck was right his attitude could certainly be improved. He had to rid himself of the stubborn bad-ass outlook that did in his father. Carson would never forget that day on the ranch when his father sucker-punched a banker. That incident had been the start of the foreclosure proceedings. His father had been his own worst enemy, and Carson was determined not to repeat his mistakes. There were a lot of Pecks in the world.<br>But it was a goddamn shame, the way the last year and a half of his life had been flushed virtually down the toilet. When he was first offered the job at GeneDyne, it had seemed the pivotal moment of his life, the one thing he&#x2019;d left home and worked so hard for. And still, more than anything, GeneDyne stood out as one place where he could really make a difference, maybe do something important. But each day that he woke up in hateful Jersey&#x2014;to the cramped, unfamiliar apartment, the gray industrial sky, and Peck&#x2014;it seemed less and less likely.<br>The lights of the conference room dimmed and went out. Window shades were automatically drawn, and a large panel slid back from the wall, revealing a bank of keyboards and a large video-projection screen.<br>The screen flickered on, and a face swam into focus. Carson froze. There they were: the jug ears, the sandy hair, the unrepentant cowlick, the thick glasses, the trademark black T-shirt, the sleepy, cynical expression. All the features that together made up the face of Brentwood Scopes, founder of GeneDyne. The <i>Time</i> issue with the cover article on Scopes still lay next to Carson&#x2019;s living-room couch. The CEO who ruled his company from cyberspace. Lionized on Wall Street, worshipped by his employees, feared by his rivals. What was this, some kind of motivational film for hard cases?<br>&#x201c;Hi,&#x201d; said the image of Scopes. &#x201c;How&#x2019;re you doing, Guy?&#x201d;<br>For a moment Carson was speechless. <i>Jesus</i>, he thought, <i>this isn&#x2019;t a film at all</i>. &#x201c;Uh, hello, Mr. Scopes. Sir. Fine. Sorry, I&#x2019;m not really dressed&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Please call me Brent. And face the screen when you talk. I can see you better that way.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not sir. Brent.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Right. Thanks, Brent.&#x201d; Just calling the supreme leader of GeneDyne by his first name was painfully difficult.<br>&#x201c;I like to think of my employees as colleagues,&#x201d; Scopes said. &#x201c;After all, when you joined the company, you became a principal in the business, like everyone else. You own stock in this company, which means we all rise and fall together.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, Brent.&#x201d; In the background, behind the image of Scopes, Carson could make out the dim outlines of what looked like a massive, many-sided vault.<br>Scopes smiled, as if unashamedly pleased at the sound of his name, and as he smiled it seemed to Carson that he looked almost like a teenager, despite being thirty-nine. He watched Scopes&#x2019;s image with a growing sense of unreality. Why would Scopes, the boy genius, the man who built a four-billion-dollar company out of a few kernels of ancient corn, want to talk to him? <i>Shit, I must have screwed up worse than I thought</i>.<br>Scopes glanced down for a moment, and Carson could hear the tapping of keys. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been looking into your background, Guy,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Very impressive. I can see why we hired you.&#x201d; More tapping. &#x201c;Although I can&#x2019;t quite understand why you&#x2019;re working as, let&#x2019;s see, a Lab Technician Three.&#x201d;<br>Scopes looked up again. &#x201c;Guy, you&#x2019;ll forgive me if I get right to the point. There&#x2019;s an important post in this company that&#x2019;s currently vacant. 1 think you&#x2019;re the person for it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; Carson blurted, instantly regretting his own excitement.<br>Scopes smiled again. &#x201c;I wish I could give you specifics, but it&#x2019;s a highly confidential project. I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ll understand if 1 only describe the assignment in general terms.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Do I look like a &#x2018;sir&#x2019; to you, Guy? It wasn&#x2019;t so long ago that I was just the nerdy kid being picked on in the schoolyard. What I <i>can</i> tell you is that this assignment involves the most important product GeneDyne has ever produced. One that will be of incalculable value to the human race.&#x201d;<br>Scopes saw the look on Carson&#x2019;s face and grinned. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s great,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;when you can help people and get rich at the same time.&#x201d; He brought his face closer to the camera. &#x201c;What we&#x2019;re offering you is a six-month reassignment to the GeneDyne Remote Desert Testing Facility. The Mount Dragon laboratory. You&#x2019;ll be working with a small, dedicated team, the best microbiologists in the company.&#x201d;<br>Carson felt a surge of excitement. Just the words <i>Mount Dragon</i> were like a magic talisman throughout all of GeneDyne: a scientific Shangri-la.<br>A pizza box was laid at Scopes&#x2019;s elbow by someone offscreen. He glanced at it, opened it up, shut the lid. &#x201c;Ah! Anchovies. You know what Churchill said about anchovies: &#x2018;A delicacy favored by English lords and Italian whores.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br>There was a short silence. &#x201c;So I&#x2019;d be going to New Mexico?&#x201d; Carson asked.<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s correct. Your part of the country, right?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I grew up in the Bootheel. At a place called Cottonwood Tanks.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I knew it had a picturesque name. You probably won&#x2019;t find Mount Dragon as harsh as some of our other people have. The isolation and the desert setting can make it a difficult place to work. But you might actually enjoy it. There are horse stables there. I suppose you must be a fairly good rider, having grown up on a ranch.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I know a bit about horses,&#x201d; Carson said. Scopes had sure as hell done his research.<br>&#x201c;Not that you&#x2019;ll have much time for riding, of course. They&#x2019;ll run you ragged, no point in saying otherwise. But you&#x2019;ll be well compensated for it. A year&#x2019;s salary for the six-month tour, plus a fifty&#x2019;thousand-dollar bonus upon successful completion. And, of course, you&#x2019;ll have my personal gratitude.&#x201d;<br>Carson struggled with what he was hearing. The bonus alone equaled his current salary.<br>&#x201c;You probably know my management methods are a little unorthodox,&#x201d; Scopes continued. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be straight with you, Guy. There&#x2019;s a downside to this. If you fail to complete your part of the project in the necessary time frame, you&#x2019;ll be ex-cessed.&#x201d; He grinned, displaying oversized front teeth. &#x201c;But I have every confidence in you. I wouldn&#x2019;t put you in this position if I didn&#x2019;t think you could do it.&#x201d;<br>Carson had to ask. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t help wondering why you chose me out of such a vast pool of talent.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Even that I can&#x2019;t tell you. When you get briefed at Mount Dragon, everything will become clear, I promise.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;When would I begin?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Today. The company needs this product, Guy, and there&#x2019;s simply no time left. You can be on our plane before lunch. I&#x2019;ll have someone take care of your apartment, car, all the annoying details. Do you have a girlfriend?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said Carson.<br>&#x201c;That makes things easier.&#x201d; Scopes smoothed down his cowlick, without success.<br>&#x201c;What about my supervisor, Fred Peck? I was supposed to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no time. Just grab your PowerBook and go. The driver will take you home to pack a few things and call whoever. I&#x2019;ll send what&#x2019;s-his-name&#x2014;Peck?&#x2014;a note explaining things.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Brent, I want you to know&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>Scopes held up a hand. &#x201c;Please. Expressions of gratitude make me uncomfortable. &#x2018;Hope has a good memory, gratitude a bad one.&#x2019; Give my offer ten minutes&#x2019; serious thought, Guy, and don&#x2019;t go anywhere.&#x201d;<br>The screen winked out on Scopes opening the pizza box again.<br>As the lights came on, Carson&#x2019;s feeling of unreality was replaced by a surge of elation. He had no idea why Scopes had reached down among the five thousand GeneDyne Ph.D.s and picked him, busy with his repetitive titrations and quality-control checks. But for the moment he didn&#x2019;t care. He thought of Peck hearing thirdhand that Scopes had personally assigned him to Mount Dragon. He thought of the look on the fat face, the wattles quivering in consternation.<br>There was a low rumbling noise as the curtains drew back from the windows, exposing the dreary vista beyond, cloaked in curtains of rain. In the gray distance, Carson could make out the power lines and smokestacks and chemical effluvia that were central New Jersey. Somewhere farther west lay a desert, with eternal sky and distant blue mountains and the pungent smell of greasewood, where you could ride all day and night and never see another human being. Somewhere in that desert stood Mount Dragon, and within it, his own secret chance to do something important.<br>Ten minutes later, when the curtains closed and the video screen came once again to life, Carson had his answer ready.<br>Copyright � 1996 by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child</p><h2>The Pirates of Somalia: Inside Their Hidden World</h2><p><p>Somalia, on the tip of the Horn of Africa, has been inhabited as far back as 9,000 BC. Its history is as rich as the country is old. Caught up in a decades-long civil war, Somalia, along with Iraq and Afghanistan, has become one of the most dangerous countries in the world. Getting there from North America is a forty-five-hour, five-flight voyage through Frankfurt, Dubai, Djibouti, Bossaso (on the Gulf of Aden), and, finally, Galkayo. Somalia is a place where a government has been built out of anarchy.<br>&nbsp;<br>For centuries, stories of pirates have captured imaginations around the world. The recent bands of daring, ragtag pirates off the coast of Somalia, hijacking multimillion-dollar tankers owned by international shipping conglomerates, have brought the scourge of piracy into the modern era.<br>&nbsp;<br>The capture of the American-crewed cargo ship <i>Maersk Alabama </i>in April 2009, the first United States ship to be hijacked in almost two centuries, catapulted the Somali pirates onto prime-time news. Then, with the horrific killing by Somali pirates of four Americans, two of whom had built their dream yacht and were sailing around the world (&#x201c;And now on to: Angkor Wat! And Burma!&#x201d; they had written to friends), the United States Navy, Special Operation Forces, FBI, Justice Department, and the world&#x2019;s military forces were put on notice: the Somali seas were now the most perilous in the world.<br>&nbsp;<br>Jay Bahadur, a journalist who dared to make his way into the remote pirate havens of Africa&#x2019;s easternmost country and spend months infiltrating their lives, gives us the first close-up look at the hidden world of the pirates of war-ravaged Somalia.<br>&nbsp;<br>Bahadur&#x2019;s riveting narrative expos�&#x2014;the first ever&#x2014;looks at who these men are, how they live, the forces that created piracy in Somalia, how the pirates spend the ransom money, how they deal with their hostages. Bahadur makes sense of the complex and fraught regional politics, the history of Somalia and the self-governing region of Puntland (an autonomous region in northeast Somalia), and the various catastrophic occurrences that have shaped their pirate destinies. The book looks at how the unrecognized mini-state of Puntland is dealing with the rise&#x2014;and increasing sophistication&#x2014;of piracy and how, through legal and military action, other nations, international shippers, the United Nations, and various international bodies are attempting to cope with the present danger and growing pirate crisis.<br><br>A revelation of a world at the epicenter of political and natural disaster.</p></p><p><p><b>Jay Bahadur</b> &#x2019;s articles have appeared in <i>The Times </i>(London), <i>The New York Times, </i>the <i>Financial Times, </i>and the <i>Globe and Mail </i>(Toronto). He has advised the United States State Department and has worked as a freelance correspondent for CBS News. He lives in Toronto.</p><b>Prologue</b> <br><br><i>Where the White Man Runs Away <br></i><br>It was my first trip to Africa. <br><br>I arrived in Somalia in the frayed seat of a 1970s Soviet Antonov propeller plane, heading into the internationally unrecognized region of Puntland on a solo quest to meet some present-day pirates. The 737s of Dubai, with their meal services and functioning seatbelts, were a distant memory; the plane I was in was not even allowed to land in Dubai, and the same probably went for the unkempt, ill-tempered Ukrainian pilot. <br><br>To the ancient Egyptians, Punt had been a land of munifi cent treasures and bountiful wealth; in present times, it was a land of peo�ple who robbed wealth from the rest of the world. Modern Puntland, a self-governing region in northeastern Somalia, may or may not be the successor to the Punt of ancient times, but I was soon to discover that it contained none of the gold and ebony that dazzled the Egyp�tians&#x2014;save perhaps for the colours of the sand and the skin of the nomadic goat and camel herders who had inhabited it for centuries. <br><br>The cabin absorbed the heat of the midday African sun like a Dutch oven, thickening the air until it was unbearable to breathe. Sweat poured freely off my skin and soaked into the torn cloth of my seat cover. Male passengers fanned themselves with the Russian-language aircraft safety cards; the women fanned their children. The high whine of the Antonov&#x2019;s propellers changed pitch as it accelerated along the Djibouti runway, building towards a droning cres cendo that I had not heard outside of decades-old movies. <br><br>The stories I had heard of these planes did nothing to put me at ease: a vodka-soaked technician banging on exposed engine parts with a wrench; a few months prior, a plant-nosed landing at Bossaso airstrip after a front landing strut had refused to extend. Later, in Bossaso, I saw the grounded craft, abandoned where it had crashed, a few lackadaisical guards posted nearby to prevent people from stripping the valuable metal. <br><br>This fl ight was like a forgotten relic of the Cold War, a physical testament to long-defunct Somali-Soviet geopolitical ties that had disintegrated with the countries themselves; its Ukrainian crew, indentured servants condemned forever to ferry passengers along this neglected route. <br><br>Over the comm system, the Somali steward offered a prayer in triplicate: <i>Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, </i>as the plane gained speed. The whine heightened to a mosquito-like buzz and we left the ground behind, setting an eastward course for Somalia, roughly shadowing the Gulf of Aden coastline. <br><br>&#x222b;&#x222b;&#x222b; <br>As I approached my thirty-fifth weary hour of travel, my desire to socialize with fellow passengers had diminished, but on purely self-serving grounds I forced myself to chat eagerly with anyone throw�ing a curious glance in my direction. I had never met my Somali host, Mohamad Farole, and any friend I made on the plane was a potential roof over my head if my ride didn&#x2019;t show. Remaining alone at the landing strip was not an option; news travels around Somalia as fast as the ubiquitous cellphone towers are able to transmit it, and a lone white man bumming around the airstrip would be public knowledge sooner than I cared to contemplate. <br><br>When he learned that I was travelling to Garowe, Puntland&#x2019;s capital city, the bearded man sitting next to me launched into the unfortunate tale of the last foreigner he knew to make a similar voyage: a few months previous, a Korean man claiming to be a Muslim had turned up in the capital, alone and unannounced. Not speaking a word of Somali, he nonetheless succeeded in fi nding a residence and beginning a life in his unusual choice of adoptive homeland. <br>He lasted almost two weeks. On his twelfth day in Puntland, a group of rifle-toting gunmen accosted the man in broad daylight as he strolled unarmed through the streets. Rather than let himself be taken hostage, the Korean made a fight of it, managing to struggle free and run. He made it several metres before one of his bemused would-be captors casually shot him in the leg. The shot set off a hue and cry, and in the ensuing clamour the gunmen dispersed and someone helped the man reach a medical clinic. I later learned from another source that he was a fugitive, on the run from the Korean authorities. His thought process, I could only assume, was that Somalia was the last place on earth that his government would look for him. He was probably right. <br><br>&#x222b;&#x222b;&#x222b; <br>Just a few months earlier, I had been a recent university graduate, killing the days writing tedious reports for a market research fi rm in Chicago, and trying to break into journalism with the occasional cold pitch to an unresponsive editor. I had no interest in journalism school, which I thought of as a waste of two of the best years of my life&#x2014;years that I should spend in the fray, learning how to do my would-be job in places where no one else would go. <br>Somalia was a good candidate, jockeying with Iraq and Afghani�stan for the title of the most dangerous country in the world. The country had commanded a soft spot in my heart since my PoliSci days, when I had wistfully dreamt of bringing the astounding demo�cratic success of the tiny self-declared Republic of Somaliland (Punt�land&#x2019;s western neighbour) to the world&#x2019;s attention. <br><br>The headline-grabbing hijacking of the tank transport MV<i> Faina </i>in September 2008 presented me with a more realistic opportunity. I sent out some feelers to a few Somali news services, and within ten minutes had received an enthusiastic response from Radio Garowe, the lone news outlet in Puntland&#x2019;s capital city. After a few long emails and a few short phone calls with Radio Garowe&#x2019;s founder, Mohamad Farole, I decided to buy a ticket to Somalia. <br><br>It took multiple tickets, as it turned out. Getting to Somalia was an aerophobe&#x2019;s nightmare&#x2014;a forty-five-hour voyage that took me through Frankfurt, Dubai, Djibouti, Bossaso, and finally Galkayo. In Dubai, I joined the crowd of diaspora Somalis, most making short visits to see their families, pushing cart upon cart overfl owing with goods from the outside world. Curious eyes began to glance my way, scanning, no doubt, for signs of mental instability. I was in no posi�tion to help them make the diagnosis; by the first leg of my trip, I had already lost the ability to judge objectively whether what I was doing was sane or not. News reports of the numerous journalists kid�napped in Puntland fixated my imagination. I channelled the hours of nervous energy into studying the lone Somali language book I had been able to dig up at the public library; I scribbled answers to exer�cises into my notebook with an odd sense of urgency, as if cramming for an exam that would take place as soon as I set foot in Somalia. <br><br>The last white face disappeared at Djibouti&#x2019;s dilapidated, near-deserted airport, as American F-16s performed eardrum-shattering training manoeuvres overhead.

Y&#39;Blood leads the reader through every stage of the battle, from the dogfights to the persistent attacks on the Japanese carriers to the frantic efforts of the returning fliers to land on friendly carriers. He takes the battle from the initial planning through the invasion of the Marianas and the recriminations that followed, describing Adm. Raymond A. Spruance&#39;s decision to allow U.S. forces to remain on the defensive and giving blow-by-blow details of the action. This intensive study of what many believe to be a major turning point in the Pacific War and the greatest carrier duel of World War II has remained an important reference since it was first published in 1981.</p><p>William T.

"From Mrs. King's ballroom dancing school I learned a proper curtsy and, believe it or not, what to do if presented with nine eating utensils at the same place setting.... From motorcycles I learned practically everything else." Pierson, an intellectual New Yorker, is open to her own contradictions--she is bold and fearful, a motorcycle-crazed poet with a Ph.D., and these seeming incompatibilities are what make this book so good. She can write equally well about the visceral pleasures of riding and about the pains of heartbreak or her own displeasure with her fears.<p> This is the motorcycle memoir for those who are sick of memoirs--or motorcycles. It is a book for people who don't know what the big deal is about riding, or why the Guggenheim Museum in New York, in a swirl of controversy, would exhibit motorcycles as works of modern art. "Riding on a motorcycle can make you feel joyous, powerful, peaceful, frightened, vulnerable, and back out to happy again," Pierson writes, "perhaps in the same ten miles. It is life compressed, its own answer to the question, 'Why?'" <i>--Maria Dolan</i></p>Melissa Holbrook Pierson is the author of The Perfect Vehicle, The Place You Love Is Gone, Dark Horses and Black Beauties, and The Man Who Would Stop at Nothing and The Secret History of Kindness.

But calls for a food revolution&#x201d; come most often from a region where the temperature rarely varies more than a few degrees. In the national conversation about developing a sustainable and equitable food tradition, the huge portion of our population who live where the soil freezes hard for months of the year feel like they're left out in the cold.<br><br><i>In Winter&#x2019;s Kitchen</i> reveals how a food movement with deep roots in the Heartland our first food co-ops, most productive farmland, and the most storied agricultural scientists hail from the region isn't only thriving, it's presenting solutions that could feed a country, rather than just a smattering of neighborhoods and restaurants. Using the story of one thanksgiving meal, Dooley discovers that a locally-sourced winter diet is more than a possibility: it can be delicious.</p><p><b>Beth Dooley</b> has been involved with the local food movement for over twenty years.

Beth and her husband have three sons and live in Minneapolis, MN.<br>Praise for <b><i>In Winter's Kitchen</i></b><br><br>"Dooley does much more than recycle familiar arguments for eating local; she personalizes the path from farm to fork with heart and skill. Unapologetically sentimental, deeply informative, and always practical . . . <i>In Winter&#x2019;s Kitchen</i> is essential reading."<i><b> Wall Street Journal</b></i><br><br>"Through her passionate yet straightforward and enticingly simple prose, Dooley invites us to share in her bounty. Like any good book about food, <i>In Winter&#x2019;s Kitchen</i> inspires us to cook."<i><b> Kansas City Star</b></i><br>"In this homage to local food, Dooley paints an exquisite portrait. Each of Dooley&#x2019;s 12 chapters showcases a different local food such as apples, wheat, chestnuts, cranberries, corn, wild rice, and sweet potatoes. The author includes a few recipes but explains that this is not a cookbook; rather, it is the story of the author building relationships with the 'small, independent farmers, processors, and chefs' who make their living building and contributing to local economies throughout the Upper Midwest.&#x201d;<i><b> Publishers Weekly</b></i><br><br>"Beth Dooley has written the book we need, a collection of stories about the foods we eat in winter, the season that is so often ignored, as if it doesn&#x2019;t count somehow, or even exist. Part memoir and part serious food study with beguiling but essential recipes, a wonderful work!" <b>Deborah Madison</b><br><br>"That Beth Dooley is a dynamite cook and journalist is a given in my book. She&#x2019;s the expert who is deep in the trenches with the farmers, the artisans, hunters and the gatherers, and every important dimension of food today. With this book you get outstanding recipes and get Beth sharing her stories, people, and insights." <b>Lynne Rossetto Kasper</b><br><br>"Beth Dooley&#x2019;s <i>In Winter's Kitchen</i> is a reflection on the way that we become at home in the world, by coming into deep relationship with our food, our farmers, our family, and the land. Each chapter celebrates the relationship between land and culture, from <i>Anishinaabek</i> wild rice to Hmong sweet potatoes. Her warm prose invites you to the kitchen table and reminds you of what we&#x2019;re all really hungry for: connection. I wanted to linger with the lush images, ripe with memory and mothering." <b>Robin Wall Kimmerer</b><br><br>"Beth Dooley creates culture in the kitchen, connecting readers, farmers, and food in the soup pot of biological diversity. Knowing where we are by the food we eat was the reality of the past and is the trend of the future. <i>In Winter&#x2019;s Kitchen</i> is a fascinating read; cultivating the knowledge we need to make diverse, local food a reliable reality the most crucial task of our time.

(Daily Telegraph)</p></p><p>Born in London, 1938, Churchill had some early acclaim with radio plays like The Ants (1962), not not not not not enough oxygen (1971) and Schreber&#39;s Nervous Illness (1972). However, it was through contact with feminism that she developed the language and structures to carry the complexity of her ideas. Top Girls (1982), perhaps Churchill&#39;s best play, keenly predicted the rise of bourgeois &#39;post-feminism&#39; in the Thatcherite 1980s, raising stimulating questions, notably in its tour de force opening where the stories of six women from history overlap, clash and connect over a restaurant meal. Fen (1983) dissected economic and sexual oppressions in the Fenlands; the Foucault-inspired Softcops (1984) considered the meanings of criminality and punishment; and Serious Money (1987) was a witty verse thriller about the City, substantially attended by its objects of attack. Churchill&#39;s witty, powerfully intelligent dialogue and her uniquely imaginative sense of structure saw her at the forefront of British playwriting in the 1980s and 1990s.</p><h2>Lawrence Booth&#x2019;s Book of Visions (Yale Series of Younger Poets)</h2><p>This year&#x2019;s winner of the Yale Series of Younger Poets competition is Maurice Manning&#x2019;s <i>Lawrence Booth&#x2019;s Book of Visions. </i>These compelling poems take us on a wild ride through the life of a man child in the rural South.

American Assassin </i>was released as a major film in 2017.<b>Chapter One</b><br><br>Anna Rielly drifted in and out of sleep, the warm sun enveloping her in a hazy dream. Her bronzed skin glistened with a mixture of sweat and sunscreen. A slight afternoon breeze floated in off the ocean. It had been the perfect week. Nothing but food, sun, sex and sleep. The ideal honeymoon. A small resort on a remote Caribbean island with their own secluded cabana, gravity pool and beach. Total privacy, no TV, no phones, no pagers, just the two of them.<br><br>She opened her eyes a touch and looked down at her wedding ring. She couldn't help but smile. She was like a schoolgirl again. It was a perfect diamond set in an elegant platinum Tiffany setting. Not too big, not too small, just right. Most important, though, it was from the right man. The man of her dreams.<br><br>She was now officially Mrs. Anna Rapp. He had been a little surprised that she'd taken his name without so much as a word of debate. She was a feminist, after all, with definite liberal leanings, but she could also be an old-fashioned romantic. She could think of no other man she respected more. It was an honor to share his name and she wanted the world to know that they were now a family. In addition, she could also be pragmatic. She had no desire to one day see her grandchildren running around with four last names. Professionally though, she would keep her maiden name. As the White House correspondent for NBC she already had name recognition and a solid career. It was a good compromise and Mitch didn't object. <br><br>Amazingly, the entire wedding had gone off without a hitch. Rielly couldn't think of a friend who didn't have at least one big blowout with her fianc�, or mother, or mother-in-law while planning her wedding. For her part, Anna had always clung to the romantic notion that one day she'd fall in love and have a big wedding back at St. Ann's in Chicago. It was where her parents had been married, where she'd been baptized and confirmed and where she and her brothers had gone to grade school. But in the months after they got engaged she could see that this was an idea Mitch was less than enthusiastic about. It wasn't that he was uncooperative. He told her that if she wanted a big wedding back in Chicago, that is what they'd do, but she could feel his apprehension. He didn't have to state it. <br><br>Mitch Rapp did not like being the center of attention. He was a man who was used to working behind the scenes. The strange truth was that her husband had been a covert operative for the CIA since the age of twenty-two. And the harsh reality was that in some circles he was known as an assassin.<br><br>In the months before their wedding, during the confirmation hearing for Mitch's boss at the CIA, a member of the House Intelligence Committee had leaked Mitch's story to the press in an attempt to derail Irene Kennedy's nomination as the next director of the Central Intelligence Agency. The president had come to both Rapp and Kennedy's defense and a version of the truth was released to the media. The president told the story of how Rapp had led a team of commandos deep into Iraq to prevent Saddam Hussein from joining the nuclear club. The president called Rapp the single most important person in America's fight against terrorism and overnight the politicians lined up to shake his hand. <br><br>Rapp had been thrust into the spotlight, and he didn't do well. Having survived for years because of his ability to move from city to city, and country to country, without being noticed, he was now recognized virtually everywhere he went. There were photographers and reporters who hounded him. Rapp tried to reason with them at first. A few listened, but most didn't. Not one to let a problem fester, Rapp arranged to have a few noses smashed. The others took the hint and backed off.<br><br>There was something else, though, that worried Rapp a great deal. He was now a marked man. Virtually every terrorist from Jakarta to London knew who he was. Bounties had been placed on his head and fatwas, Islamic religious decrees, had been thrown down by dozens of fanatical Muslim clerics across Arabia, Asia and the Pacific Rim. Thousands if not millions of crazed Islamic zealots would gladly give their lives to take him down.<br><br>Rapp worried incessantly about Anna's safety and had even asked her if she was sure she still wanted to spend the rest of her life looking over her shoulder. Without hesitation she had said yes and told him not to insult her by bringing it up again. He had stoically honored her request, but it didn't stop his worrying. He'd also taken some serious precautions, having ordered her a customized BMW with bulletproof glass, Kevlar-lined body, and shredproof tires. They were also in the process of building a house on twenty acres outside D.C. in rural Virginia. Anna had asked more than once where the money came from to pay for all this, but Rapp had always deflected her questions with a joke or change of subject. She knew he was a man of many means, and in the end she reasoned that there were some things she was better off not knowing.<br><br>When they sat down to plan the wedding, Rapp brought up a laundry list of security concerns that would have to be addressed. As the weeks passed, Anna began to realize that he simply would not be able to enjoy the day if they held such a large wedding. She made the decision then to have a small private ceremony with their families and a few close friends. The news had been received well by Mitch.<br><br>The event was held where they'd met. At the White House. Anna's entire family, her mom and dad, brothers and sisters-in-law and seven nieces and nephews were there. Mitch's only surviving relative, his brother Steven, was best man while Anna's longtime friend Liz O'Rourke was the matron of honor. Dr. Irene Kennedy and a few of Rapp's friends from the CIA were present as well as a select group of Anna's media friends. Father Malone from St. Ann's was flown in to officiate and the president and the first lady were the perfect hosts. President Hayes also used his significant clout to make sure there wasn't a mention of the wedding in any of the papers or on TV. It was agreed by all that it would be wise to keep the identity of Mrs. Mitch Rapp off the front pages.<br><br>The guests all stayed at the Hay Adams Hotel, just a short walk across Lafayette Park from the White House. They celebrated well into the night and then the bride and groom were taken by the Secret Service to Reagan National Airport where they caught a private jet to their island. Courtesy of the CIA, they were traveling under the assumed identities of Troy and Betsy Harris.<br><br>Anna sat up and looked over the edge of the patio down at the beach. Her husband was coming out of the water after a swim. Naturally dark-skinned, after a week in the sun he looked like he'd gone native. The man was a prime physical specimen, and she wasn't just thinking that because she was married to him. In his twenties he'd been a world-class triathlete who competed in events around the world. He'd won the famous Iron Man competition in Hawaii twice. Now he was in his mid-thirties, and was still in great shape.<br><br>Rapp sported some other physical features that had taken Rielly a little getting used to. He had three visible bullet scars: one on his leg and two on his stomach. There was a fourth that was covered by a thick scar on his shoulder where the doctors had torn him open to get at the bullet and reconstruct his shoulder socket. There was an elongated knife scar on his right side, and one last scar that he was particularly proud of. It was a constant reminder of the man he had sworn he would kill when he started on his crazy journey into the world of counterterrorism. It ran along the left side of his face, from his ear down to his jawline. The plastic surgeons had minimized the scar to a thin line, but more important to Rapp, the man who had marked him was now dead.<br><br>Rapp stepped onto the patio, water dripping from his shorts, and smiled at his bride. "How ya' doin', honey?"<br><br>"Fine." She reached out her hand for him. "I was just dozing off a bit."<br><br>Rapp bent down and kissed her and then without saying another word he jumped into the small pool. He came up and rested his arms and chin on the edge. "Are you ready to go back tomorrow?"<br><br>She shook her head and pouted prettily for him.<br><br>Rapp smiled. She really made him happy. She was smart, funny and drop-dead gorgeous. She could be a bit of a ballbuster at times, but he supposed any woman who was going to put up with him had to be able to assert herself or it'd be only a matter of years before he screwed everything up. <br><br>"Well, we'll just have to stay a little longer, then," he said.<br><br>She shook her head again and put the pouty lips back on.<br><br>Reaching across the patio for the bucket of iced Red Stripe, he laughed to himself. He'd called her bluff. She needed to get back to work or the network would have a complete shit fit. If Rapp had it his way she'd quit. The exposure was an ever increasing risk to her safety. But Anna had to come to that conclusion on her own. He didn't want to wake up ten years from now and have her go nuts on him for making her throw her career away. His only consolation was that her current assignment at the White House meant close proximity to more than a dozen well-armed and supremely trained Secret Service agents and officers.<br><br>"Would you like a beer, honey?"<br><br>"Sure."<br><br>Rapp opened one, handed the ice-cold bottle to Anna and then opened one for himself. Reaching out with his bottle he waited for his wife to do the same. The two bottles clinked together and Rapp said, "To us."<br><br>"To us," she replied with a blissful smile.<br><br>They both took a drink and Rapp added, "And lots of cute healthy babies." <br><br>Anna laughed and held up two fingers.<br><br>Rapp shook his head. "At least five."<br><br>She laughed even louder. "You're nuts."<br><br>"I never said I wasn't."<br><br>They sat there basking in the sun, talking about their future for the better part of an hour, teasing each other playfully about how many kids they were going to have, how they were going to be raised, what names they liked and what they would do if one of the kids was as stubborn as either of them. Rapp refrained from sharing his opinion as she talked about what she would do with her job after they had a baby. It was one of those new things he'd learned about relationships. He understood that she was talking it out, and not looking for him to throw in his own two cents.<br><br>For her part, Anna kept her promise that she would steer clear of digging for details on the goings-on at Langley. Rapp knew that if they were going to survive in the long run he would have to share certain aspects of his job with her, regardless of what Agency policy dictated. Anna was too curious to spend the rest of their lives never discussing what he spent the majority of the week doing. The general subjects of terrorism and national security were fair game, but anything involving specific intelligence or covert policy was off the table. Having been silent for so many years, Rapp actually found it satisfying to be able to share his opinions with someone who had a decent grasp of the issues. <br><br>They opened two more beers and Anna joined him in the water. They clung to the edge of the gravity pool and looked out at the ocean, their elbows and chins resting on the edge, their legs gently floating behind them. They laughed about the wedding and their week of seclusion and avoided mentioning that it was about to end. Rapp could tell that Anna was getting tipsy. She weighed only 115 pounds and the combination of beer, warm sun and a lazy breeze meant a siesta was in the cards.<br><br>After a little while she kissed him on the lips and swam to the other end of the small pool. Climbing out, she stopped on the top step and pulled her hair into a loose ponytail. As she twisted it with both hands the water cascaded down her smooth back and over her tiny white bikini bottom. With a flirtatious glance over her shoulder she began to unhook her top. "I'm going to go take a nap. Would you like to join me?" Keeping her back to him, she slipped off her bikini top and draped it over the hammock hook to her right.<br><br>Needing no further encouragement, Rapp set his beer down and hoisted himself over the edge. He followed his wife into the bedroom, losing his swim trunks along the way. His eyes never left her body, and for a brief moment he found himself wishing they could stay on this tiny island forever.<br><br>When they got back to Washington it wouldn't be like this. There would be fires to be put out and plans to be put into action. He watched Anna slip out of her bikini bottom, and the problems awaiting him in Washington vanished. They could wait, at least for another day. Right now he had more important things on his mind.<br><br>Copyright � 2003 by Vince Flynn</p><h2>The Tribe of Witches: The Religion of the Dobunni and Hwicce</h2><p>Until now the old religions of Britain have only been looked at in a piecemeal way. This book presents a detailed and focused investigation of the religion of the Dobunni and the Hwicce peoples who occupied the Severn valley and the Cotswolds immediately before and after the Roman occupation. It uncovers some secrets of the old religion of Britain that have lain hidden in reams of unconnected and largely forgotten information, from a variety of sources. The first part of the book concerns the deification of the natural world; the second, the deities of the tribal groups. It explores the deities of the different areas of the Dobunnic/Hwiccan territory; identifying the goddess of the Cotswolds, and describes how the worship manifested itself. Yeates demonstrates how the deification of rivers was important and how this has led to the location of a number of ancient river shrines as well as the identification of a number of monumental arrangements used by the peoples in their religious activities and folk-group identity; numerous recognizably pre-Old English folk-names are also shown to relate specifically to river-names, town-names, and folk-group-names. The religious use of the hill-forts, of which there are so many dotted over the landscape, and their shrines is discussed. These are connected with mineral extraction, warfare, nemetons, and sacred groves. The use for standing totems and burial practices is also covered. Once the associations are made between deity, river, and folk-group, and all other aspects of religion have been discussed the deity who resided over the Dobunni is revealed. Her cult, which was evident in the major Roman towns, can be traced back into the Iron Age, and can be identified as the inspiration for the tribal name Hwicce . This shows an element of continuity in British culture, not recognized previously because of the assumed obliteration of British culture due to the extent, success, and longevity of the Roman occupation and Anglo-Saxon migration. Understanding the tribal goddess also explains why this people were &#34;the tribe of witches&#34;. Finally, it is recognised that these gods did not perish but persisted in medieval legends, traditions and place-names. Although at its core this is a study of two British tribes, the work will have a major impact on the understanding of pre-Christian religion not only in Britain but also in Western Europe generally.</p><p>Stephen Yeates is a junior research fellow at Wolfson College, University of Oxford and an Honorary Research Associate of the Institute of Archaeology, University of Oxford. His previous publications include Religion, community, and territory: defining Religion in the Severn Valley and adjacent hills from the Iron Age to the early medieval period (BAR 2006).The book is highly informative.

We can see farther than the keenest cheetah or lynx. We can look over the horizon, around the world, up into space, down into our intestines digesting dinner. Nothing can escape our eye. We can watch practically anything we want&#x2014;the only thing is, most of what we look at comes down a cable. Using the naked eye is fast going out of style. Why bother when a camera will do it better? The image is becoming more real to us than the real thing.<br><br> There is a man in England who does his bird watching in front of the television. He doesn&#x2019;t need binoculars. He will watch the golf tournaments for the chance flight of a heron across the green. He will watch nature programs, not for the lion strutting in the foreground, but for the little bird in the background that the commentator neglects even to mention. His greatest thrill is to identify a bird on his screen and check it off his list as &#x201c;seen.&#x201d;<br><br> Not just our eyes, but all of our senses are losing the original savor of first-hand experience. We live in an ocean of smell but smother it in detergents, disinfectants, and artificial perfumes. Millions wear little white earphones and hear only faintly the sounds of the living world they are passing through. We are becoming out of touch with the earth we live on, and fast. We need to come to our senses before we lose them.<br><br> This physical life is to die for. When we stop for a moment to register how alive everything is&#x2014;every cell of our own body, every turning leaf, every drop of rain&#x2014;we can begin to catch on to the fact that all of Nature is sensual by nature.<br><br> One way this came home to me was, of all things, from the lick of a Jersey cow. She had idled over to me at the gate of a field on the edge of the Cotswolds in England. Her slab of a tongue, hot with a steamy, grassy breath, curled out and began rasping across the back of my hand on the gate. That slow, grating rub, like a worn kitchen scourer, heaved itself lazily over my flesh with an undeniable empathy of beast to man. Less sloppy than a dog, slower of pace, more casual altogether than any animal I can think of, that Jersey cow had the time of day for me, or for anyone who cared to lean over the gate and offer their salt; for it was that she was after, however much my sentiments might have liked it to be otherwise.<br><br> It may sound strange, but that lick from a Jersey cow was erotic. The word has come to have an almost exclusively sexual connotation, but being moved and touched is always at the heart of what it means to be erotic: to be in a living, felt relationship with life, with all our senses and intelligence. In the Greek myth, where Psyche is another name for the human soul, Pleasure was the child of Psyche and Eros. Pleasure, then, is the result of the passage of Eros. It is an erotic response to life, one that is physically moving. The body shudders, quivers, and trembles with pleasure in striking some chord with the world around it.<br><br> That&#x2019;s one of the many good things about having a body&#x2014;you can be moved and touched by, literally be in touch with, other bodies. We all love to touch and be touched, not least because it brings us to earth, to our own ground, and to the common ground we share with others. Touch is the primary human experience. It is the first sense to develop; babies can die if they are not held, and their cries are often for touch as much as for food. My wife&#x2019;s most cherished memory is of holding her newborn child and smelling the top of its head.<br><br> As children we are always in touch, having our hands in everything. We squeeze mud between our fingers, play with sand, pick up worms; even as adults we find it hard to keep our hands off &#x201c;safer&#x201d; objects like the goods in a furniture store or bread at the baker&#x2019;s.<br><br> Hands have a life of their own. They have a way of taking hold of things before our social conditioning has time to stop them. They finger the fresh fruit in the grocery store, half consciously brush the arm of the person we are talking to, run along the backs of wooden chairs.<br><br> My own love the firm shake of another&#x2019;s hand, the grasp of a doorknob, the soft stroke of wool, angularities and corners, globes of the world, plump strands of seaweed, the feel of a sculpture in a museum, and of course, the swell of my lover&#x2019;s breast or the curve of her thigh.<br><br> The kiss, our first intimate touch, begins with the feeding from our mother&#x2019;s breast; and from that early start, nourishment, aggression, comfort, and sexuality are all intermingled in the intimate pleasures of the mouth. A kiss can be an expression of desire, of friendship and greeting, of loyalty, or of spiritual blessing. A kiss can open the door to a person&#x2019;s heart; it can be a self-revelation; or as it was for Salman Rushdie, who grew up in India, it can be a simple way of honoring the world of everyday objects that we rely on:<br><br> I grew up kissing books and bread. In our house, whenever anyone dropped a book or let fall a chapati . . . the fallen object was required not only to be picked up but also kissed, by way of apology for the act of clumsy disrespect. Devout households in India often contained, and still contain, persons in the habit of kissing holy books. But we kissed everything. If I&#x2019;d ever dropped the telephone directory I&#x2019;d probably have kissed that too. Bread and books: food for the body and food for the soul&#x2014;what could be more worthy of respect than that?<br><br> Rushdie&#x2019;s kisses were not sentimental; they were genuine expressions of regard for the world we live in. Neither Nature nor possessions need our sentimentality, our fantasies of what we think they are. They don&#x2019;t need us to foist some meaning on them that we may have lost in ourselves. What they do need is for us to give them the attention and respect due to them as part of the living world.<br><br> Wordsworth thought that Nature was a necessary second mother for the preadolescent child, and if that relationship was missing, the child&#x2019;s imagination would be stunted in some way in later life. Imagination, he would say, feeds on old tree roots, the smell of wet grass, the shimmer of corn in the sun.<br><br> Old tree roots in a rolling beech wood in upstate New York: I can sense it now, their musty, truffly smell reaching back into the more ancient regions of my brain. Smell has to be the most underrated of all our senses. We would be wise to let ourselves be led by the nose now and again. Smells inform our deepest instincts and intuitions, which is why we have expressions like &#x201c;to smell a rat,&#x201d; &#x201c;to smell an opportunity,&#x201d; or &#x201c;to smell something fishy.&#x201d; In Inuit tribes the common greeting of rubbing noses has its basis in &#x201c;smelling out&#x201d; the intentions of others. In Asian countries like Borneo, Burma, and India the word for &#x201c;kiss&#x201d; also means &#x201c;smell.&#x201d;<br><br> Everything we taste is snatched from death: our responsibility is to taste it completely.<br><br> John Tarrant<br><br> Smells can also serve to dredge up long-forgotten memories, and they do so because they are an essential component of our emotional &#x201c;read&#x201d; of a situation or a moment in time. Charles Dickens claimed that the merest hint of the type of paste used to fasten labels to bottles would plunge him into the anguish of his early years, when bankruptcy forced his father to abandon him in a warehouse where they made such bottles.<br><br> I had my own experience of the power of scent over memory when I was in Branscombe, one of those English villages that seems made for a picture postcard, all thatched roofs and little winding streets. I was walking past a cottage covered with roses and honeysuckle. I was about to lean into the roses when I suddenly caught the scent of something more humble. It was a faint tang, somewhat like pepper, not entirely pleasant but not unpleasant, either.<br><br> I turned my head. A pot of geraniums was hanging from the porch, and as I caught their smell, I instantly became eight years old again. On my way to school I would pick a leaf from the geraniums that hung over our neighbor&#x2019;s garden wall and enjoy the tingling sensation it sparked in my mouth. In that smell was the thrill of a private enjoyment, the pleasure of being out in the world on my own, in that exciting stretch of public domain that lay between the familiarity of home and the ordered safety of school.<br><br> Our sense of smell matters; it plays a large but usually unnoticed role in everyday decisions. It determines, often against all reason, our attraction or aversion to others. The male essential oil is androsterone. It smells approximately of musk, sandalwood, and a nuance of urine. Experiments have shown women selecting only the chairs, telephones, and theater seats that had been presprayed with this masculine odor. A woman smells sweetest and is thus most attractive during ovulation, when the rise in her blood sugar level adds to the sweetness of her breath.<br><br> Your lover&#x2019;s odor is certainly part of their attraction for you. That&#x2019;s probably why you like to wear his shirt or use his pillow when he is away, and why he is always sniffing your hair and around your neck. But we wouldn&#x2019;t want to go so far today as women did back in Elizabethan times. Then a woman would put a peeled apple under her arm for a while and offer the &#x201c;love apple&#x201d; to her beloved as a gift. Even Napoleon asked Josephine not to wash in the two weeks before they would next meet, so he could enjoy her natural perfume undiluted.<br><br> When we make love in the way E...</p><h2>The Fox Hunt (Pettson and Findus)</h2><p>Pettson Findus and some hens live on a little farm in the country.

Myles becomes friends with Hannah Kemp, who introduces him to William Tyndale, the Bible translator hated by the king. Myles recognizes his love for Hannah but is obsessed with Isabella, a selfish maid of the court. On her deathbed, Myles' mother confesses to Sir Robert Wakefield that Myles is his son. Wakefield adopts Myles, preempting his young cousin, Ralph Geddes, of the inheritance he thought would be his. Promising to get revenge, Geddes marries Isabella and pursues Myles, who is helping Tyndale smuggle Bibles from Germany to England. Geddes also plants Bibles in Wakefield's home, causing him to be imprisoned and compelling Myles to search for ways to convince the king to release him. Through a succession of dramatic events, Morris brings his story to a bittersweet conclusion: Geddes replaces Wakefield in prison, but Tyndale is executed.

Scott Fitzgerald Hardback Collection)</h2><p>These sumptuous new hardback editions mark the 70th anniversary of Fitzgerald&#39;s death. Their eyes &#39;met and tangled. For an instant they made love as no one ever dares to do after. Their glance was slower than an embrace, more urgent than a call&#39;. A novel of the glittering decadence of Hollywood in its heyday, this was Fitzgerald&#39;s last work and he died without completing it. The novel&#39;s tragic tycoon hero is Stahr. Caught in the crossfire of his own effortless cynicism and his silent, secret vulnerability, Stahr inhabits a world dominated by business, alcohol and promiscuity. If there is a moral or social necessity to film-making in this West Coast never-never land, Stahr does not always believe in it. If there is love he does not always see it. The sharpness of Fitzgerald&#39;s prose, the steely simplicity of his style, give a cutting edge to this study of Hollywood in the thirties, from which Fitzgerald draws a painfully bitter-sweet love affair and bids his own poignant farewell to the Great American Dream.</p><p>Francis Scott Fitzgerald was born in 1896 in Saint Paul, Minnesota, and educated at Princeton. Stationed in Alabama, he met and later married Zelda Sayre. His first novel, This Side of Paradise published in 1920, was a tremendous critical and commercial success. Fitzgerald followed with The Beautiful and the Damned in 1922, The Great Gatsby in 1925 and Tender is the Night in 1934.

The main reason he's been able to keep clean: his dealer's in jail, which leaves Jack without a source. When that dealer calls him to Dublin and asks a favor in the soiled, sordid visiting room of Mountjoy Prison, Jack wants to tell him to take a flying leap. But he doesn't, can't, because the dealer's sister is dead, and the guards have called it "death by misadventure." <br> <br>The dealer knows that can't be true and begs Jack to have a look, check around, see what he can find out. It's exactly what Jack does, with varying levels of success, to make a living. But he's reluctant, maybe because of who's asking or maybe because of the bad feeling growing in his gut.<br> <br>Never one to give in to bad feelings or common sense, Jack agrees to the favor, though he can't possibly know the shocking, deadly consequences he has set in motion. But he and everyone he holds dear will find out soon, sooner than anyone knows, in the lean and lethal fourth entry in Ken Bruen's award-winning Jack Taylor series.<br></p><p>Ken Bruen has been a finalist for the Edgar, Anthony, and Barry Awards, and has won a Macavity Award and a Shamus Award for the Jack Taylor series. He lives in Galway, Ireland.<br>In the fourth adventure of drunken Irish policeman Jack Taylor, he's sober and no longer a cop. That doesn't prevent him from investigating the murders of two college girls, which police think are strange coincidences. Narrator Michael Deehy is expert at playing the snaky detective, but can the police really be that stupid? Deehy single-handedly creates Galway, down to the last brick. The doting landlady, the stout best friend, the pretentious professor are all real and convincing. But while the story is fascinating and perfectly delivered, it sometimes seems like a story told by a long-winded guy at an Irish pub with a pint of Guinness and a love of his own voice.

This is the richest and most revealing portrait of a movie classic in-the-making ever compiled, from casting decisions to personality clashes, from anecdotes about one of Hollywood&#39;s most celebrated--and feared--directors to the truth about why the FBI needed to protect Janet Leigh after the opening of the film.</p><p>Not only is Alfred Hitchcock's <i>Psycho</i> hugely popular and influential 35 years after its release; it also remains the main claim to fame of Leigh, who portrayed murder victim Marion Crain. Leigh here offers her memoirs of filming <i>Psycho</i>, including the famous shower sequence, to which she accords an entire chapter. Although she provides some fascinating glimpses of Hitchcock's on-set technique and other behind-the-scenes details, Leigh devotes too many pages to gushing about her coworkers and other inconsequential matters, to diverting but essentially trivial passages on how <i>Psycho</i> changed her life, and to her rather banal thoughts on the effects of today's even more violent films. Fortunately, coauthor Nickens is on hand to supply informative "intermissions" in which he fleshes out Leigh's comments, provides technical information, and offers background on Hitchcock. Rebello's <i>Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho</i> (1990) is a much better all-around resource on the film, but libraries where that work has proved popular should also see demand for Leigh's more personal account. <i>Gordon Flagg</i>Leigh is perhaps best remembered for her role as Marion Crane, who is stabbed to death in the shower sequence of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. Opening to mixed reviews in 1960, Psycho's sleazy storyline so spooked Paramount Pictures that Hitchcock was forced to finance it himself. So recounts Leigh in this amiable, somewhat scattershot look at the making of Psycho, occasioned, she notes, by the film's continuing popularity and the "blatant inaccuracies" that surround it. Attempting "to set the record straight," she recalls the jovial atmosphere on the set, the moleskin suit she wore in the shower, the ingenious publicity campaign for the film, her nomination for an academy award and her ongoing, real-life aversion to showers. Included are conversations with screenwriter Joseph Stefano and others, and fond remembrances of Anthony Perkins and "Mr. Hitchcock." Less compelling is Leigh's bubbly, critical evaluation of the film itself. Nickens has written biographies of Elizabeth Taylor and other performers.

Her name is Wild Woman, but she is an endangered species. Though the gifts of wildish nature come to us at birth, society&#39;s attempt to &#34;civilize&#34; us into rigid roles has plundered this treasure, and muffled the deep, life-giving messages of our own souls. Without Wild Woman, we become over-domesticated, fearful, uncreative, trapped. Clarissa Pinkola Estes, Ph.D., Jungian analyst and cantadora storyteller, shows how woman&#39;s vitality can be restored through what she calls &#34;psychic archeological digs&#34; into the bins of the female unconscious. In Women Who Run with the Wolves, Dr. Estes uses multicultural myths, fairy tales, folk tales, and stories chosen from over twenty years of research that help women reconnect with the healthy, instinctual, visionary attributes of the Wild Woman archetype. Dr. Estes collects the bones of many stories, looking for the archetypal motifs that set a woman&#39;s inner life into motion. &#34;La Loba&#34; teaches about the transformative function of the psyche. In &#34;Bluebeard&#34;, we learn what to do with wounds that will not heal; in &#34;Skeleton Woman&#34;, we glimpse the mystical power of relationship and how dead feelings can be revived; &#34;Vasalisa the Wise&#34; brings our lost womanly instincts to the surface again; &#34;The Handless Maiden&#34; recovers the Wild Woman initiation rites; and &#34;The Little Match Girl&#34; warns against the insidious dangers of a life spent in fantasy. In these and other stories, we focus on the many qualities of Wild Woman. We retrieve, examine, love, and understand her, and hold her against our deep psyches as one whois both magic and medicine. In Women Who Run with the Wolves, Dr. Estes has created a new lexicon for describing the female psyche. Fertile and lifegiving, it is a psychology of women in the truest sense, a knowing of the soul."WOMEN WHO RUN WITH THE WOLVES isn't just another book. It is a gift of profound insight, wisdom, and love.

After studying at the Alberta College of Art and Design, he broke into comics first with<i>&nbsp;Skywald</i>&nbsp;and then at Charlton, where he created the character Rog-2000. Following his tenure at Charlton, Byrne moved to Marvel, where his acclaimed runs on&nbsp;<i>The Uncanny X-Men</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Fantastic Four</i>&nbsp;soon made him one of the most popular artists in the industry. In 1986 he came to DC to revamp Superman from the ground up, and since then he has gone on to draw and/or write every major character at both DC and Marvel.</p><h2>Open Secret: Postmessianic Messianism and the Mystical Revision of Menahem Mendel Schneerson</h2><p><p>Menahem Mendel Schneerson (1902-1994) was the seventh and seemingly last Rebbe of the Habad-Lubavitch dynasty. Marked by conflicting tendencies, Schneerson was a radical messianic visionary who promoted a conservative political agenda, a reclusive contemplative who built a hasidic sect into an international movement, and a man dedicated to the exposition of mysteries who nevertheless harbored many secrets. Schneerson astutely masked views that might be deemed heterodox by the canons of orthodoxy while engineering a fundamentalist ideology that could subvert traditional gender hierarchy, the halakhic distinction between permissible and forbidden, and the social-anthropological division between Jew and Gentile. </p><p>While most literature on the Rebbe focuses on whether or not he identified with the role of Messiah, Elliot R. Wolfson, a leading scholar of Jewish mysticism and the phenomenology of religious experience, concentrates instead on Schneerson's apocalyptic sensibility and his promotion of a mystical consciousness that undermines all discrimination. For Schneerson, the ploy of secrecy is crucial to the dissemination of the messianic secret. To be enlightened messianically is to be delivered from all conceptual limitations, even the very notion of becoming emancipated from limitation. The ultimate liberation, or true and complete redemption, fuses the believer into an infinite essence beyond all duality, even the duality of being emancipated and not emancipated&#x2014;an emancipation, in other words, that emancipates one from the bind of emancipation. </p><p>At its deepest level, Schneerson's eschatological orientation discerned that a spiritual master, if he be true, must dispose of the mask of mastery. Situating Habad's thought within the evolution of kabbalistic mysticism, the history of Western philosophy, and Mahayana Buddhism, Wolfson articulates Schneerson's rich theology and profound philosophy, concentrating on the nature of apophatic embodiment, semiotic materiality, hypernomian transvaluation, nondifferentiated alterity, and atemporal temporality.</p></p><p><p>Elliot R. Wolfson is the Abraham Lieberman Professor of Hebrew and Judaic Studies at New York University. He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a Fellow of the American Academy of Jewish Research. He is the author of numerous essays and books, including <i>Through a Speculum that Shines: Vision and Imagination in Medieval Jewish Mysticism</i>, which was awarded the National Jewish Book Award for Scholarship and the AAR Award for Excellence in Historical Studies; <i>Along the Path: Studies in Kabbalistic Myth, Symbolism, and Hermeneutics</i>; <i>Circle in the Square: Studies in the Use of Gender in Kabbalistic Symbolism</i>; <i>Abraham Abulafia-Kabbalist and Prophet: Hermeneutics, Theosophy, and Theurgy</i>; <i>Language, Eros, Being: Kabbalistic Hermeneutics and Poetic Imagination</i>, which was awarded the National Jewish Book Award in Scholarship; <i>Alef, Mem, Tau: Kabbalistic Musings on Time, Truth, and Death</i>; <i>Venturing Beyond Law and Morality in Kabbalistic Mysticism</i>; and <i>Luminal Darkness: Imaginal Gleanings From Zoharic Literature</i>.</p><p>A poetic blend of scholarship and philosophy unprecedented and often breathtaking in its boldness, <i>Open Secret</i> negotiates the vast range of Lubavitcher literature by and about Menahem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe. From an authoritatively learned but nonsectarian perspective, <i>Open Secret</i> reads the Rebbe's messianism seriously. Elliot R. Wolfson confronts the Rebbe as a major figure in the Jewish esoteric tradition. The Lubavitcher Rebbe's Messiah presents a challenge that is inescapable for anyone who seeks to understand a twenty-first-century globalized Judaism, and Wolfson compellingly engages that challenge.</p> (Steve Wasserstrom, Reed College)</p><h2>Pirates on the Prairie</h2><p>Pirates on the Prairie chronicles the achievements of a remarkable group of athletes who explode out of tiny Halstad, Minnesota, in 1952 to take the state by storm. Bergeson does more than follow the exploits of a high school basketball team and a high school baseball team. He takes the reader back in time by tracing the history of northwestern Minnesota and describing how the early Norwegians settled the land. He outlines the hardships faced by these hardy Scandinavians as they built schools, churches, and businesses. Bergeson also highlights Halstad&#39;s famous native, Skitch Henderson, who was Johnny Carson&#39;s first bandleader on The Tonight Show. Lute Olson, former area resident and University of Arizona men&#39;s basketball coach, says &#34;Reading Pirates on the Prairie was a look into my own Midwestern Scandinavian background.&#34; In his book, Bergeson explains that World War I brought prosperity to the Red River Valley area. But, while the country was enjoying Babe Ruth, the Great Gatsby, and Charles Lindberg, the rural economy was declining. Just as Sinclair Lewis in Main Street punctured the balloon of the small town mystique, the market system dismantled the family farm. A mass exodus from farming began despite the efforts of Franklin Roosevelt, the WPA, and the REA. Then Bergeson turns his attention to a group of boys growing up in Minnesota. He traces the development of these players and their families while vividly bringing to life the environment that nourished them. Bergeson takes the reader through the exciting 1952 season and the pivotal game with the Thief River Falls Prowlers that propels the Halstad Pirates to the Minnesota State Basketball Tournament in Minneapolis. Gradually, Pirates on the Prairie answers the fundamental question: How did this improbable story happen? At the same time, the reader detects a foreboding undercurrent-a story of loss. For the book also documents a profound change in rural American culture that is felt today.</p><p></p><h2>Chihuly Seaforms</h2><p>The third and final installment in the individual small book series includes Seaforms, Venetians, Macchia, and Ikebana.

Originally serialized (much like the History of the Second World War series of the &#39;70s), this work is distinguished by a large number of excellent photos, numerous sidebars detailing the major weapons used by both sides, explanations of tactics, and many eye-witness accounts from participants on both sides. Perhaps because this is a British work, there is greater attention given to the non-American allies fighting in Vietnam, especially the Koreans and Australians. In addition, there are several articles written by members of the Vietcong and North Vietnamese Army, providing an unusual perspective on the fighting. The history takes you from the first landings of U.S. Marines at Da Nang in 1964 through the fall of Saigon in 1975, the Vietnamese/Cambodian wars, and a brief overview of Vietnam in the mid-1980s.</p><p></p><h2>American Needlework Treasures: Samplers and Silk Embroideries from the Collection of Betty Ring</h2><p>If you weren&#39;t able to attend the auction at Sotheby&#39;s here&#39;s the next best thing!

And through these lovingly recounted stories-wildly comic or heartbreakingly tragic-we discover the hope against hope upon which every family must sometimes rely.</p><p>For the MacDonalds, the past is <i>not</i> a foreign country. This Cape Breton clan may have lived in the New World since 1779, when Calum Ruadh ("the red Calum") and his wife, 12 children, and dog landed. Scotland, however, remains their true home. So profound is their connection to their lost land that on brief visits they find themselves welcomed by strangers. When one descendent tells a Scotswoman that she's from Canada, she is offered a gentle rejoinder: "That may be.... But you are really from here. You have just been away for a while." In some ways this is unsurprising, since the MacDonalds either have deep black hair or their ancestor's coloring. And those with the latter have "eyes that were so dark as to be beyond brown and almost in the region of glowing black. Such individuals would manifest themselves as strikingly unfamiliar to some, and as eerily familiar to others." Another sport of nature? Many are fraternal twins, including Alistair MacLeod's narrator, Alexander, and his sister.<p> But <i>No Great Mischief</i> is far more than the straightforward saga of one family over the generations. Instead the author has created a painfully beautiful myth in which the long-ago is in many ways more present than modern existence. Even in the last decades of the 20th century, the MacDonalds fall into Gaelic--its inflections, rhythms, and song--with deep nostalgia. This is a family that is used to composing itself in the face of disaster. They often assure one another, "My hope is constant in thee," and in the light of their many losses, the clan must cling to its motto. </p><p> <i>No Great Mischief</i> begins with Alexander's visit to Toronto, where his eldest brother now subsists on a diet of drink and memories. The narrator, a successful orthodontist, doesn't have much to do with the former but is unable (or unwilling) to escape the latter. As the novel proceeds, Alexander fills in his family history, including such key episodes as his great-great-grandfather's self-exile from Scotland. Though Calum Ruadh had intended to leave his dog behind, it broke away and tried to catch up with him. MacLeod piercingly captures the animal's struggle as her master first tries to make her head for shore and then--realizing she won't desert him--spurs her on. Throughout <i>No Great Mischief</i> various people recall this incident, an emblem of intensity, hope, and dependence. A descendant of the bitch is also on hand when Alexander's parents and one of his brothers disappear under the ice on a cold spring night. She persists in searching for her people and tries to protect their lighthouse from the new keeper, receiving in return "four bullets into her loyal waiting heart." When Alexander's grandfather hears of her death, he uses a phrase that becomes one of the book's litanies, "It was <i>in</i> those dogs to care too much and to try too hard." </p><p> This is a MacDonald characteristic as well. A good deal of <i>No Great Mischief</i>'s strength stems from scenes of longing and despair--for those who die for a lost cause, whether in 1692 when one leader is killed ("the redness of his hair dyed forever brighter by the crimson of his blood") or in an Ontario uranium mine where one brother is decapitated. MacLeod evokes his clan, and the elemental beauty of their landscape, in quiet, precise language that gains power with each repetition. (A sentence such as "All of us are better when we're loved" comes to acquire a near proverbial ring.) If he occasionally tips his hand too much, pressing home his point that present-day prosperity isn't all it's cracked up to be, no matter. I doubt that this inspired and elegiac novel will ever leave those who are lucky enough to read it--proving after all the persistence of the <i>clann Chalum Ruaidh</i>. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>"One of the great undiscovered writers of our time."&#x2013;Michael Ondaatje</p><h2>Brief Loves That Live Forever: A Novel</h2><p><p><b>A beautifully observed and moving account of love and the human spirit in the Soviet era</b><br><b></b><br>In Soviet Russia the desire for freedom is also a desire for the freedom to love. Lovers live as outlaws, traitors to the collective spirit, and love is more intense when it feels like an act of resistance. Now entering middle age, an orphan recalls the fleeting moments that have never left him-a scorching day in a blossoming orchard with a woman who loves another; a furtive, desperate affair in a Black Sea resort; the bunch of snowdrops a crippled childhood friend gave him to give to his lover. As the dreary Brezhnev era gives way to perestroika and the fall of Communism, the orphan uncovers the truth behind the life of Dmitri Ress, whose tragic fate embodies the unbreakable bond between love and freedom.</p><p>"Makine has been compared to Stendhal, Tolstoy and Proust; our best historians of the Soviet era queue up to pronounce him one of the finest living writers on the period; and he is regularly tipped to be among the contenders for the next Nobel in literature." -<i>The Daily Telegraph</i></p></p><p><b>Andre� Makine</b> was born in 1957 in Siberia and has lived in France for more than twenty years.

It tells of the orphan Heidi and her idyllic existence with her gruff grandfather in the mountains. When she is sent to live in a city, comic chaos ensues, and eventually it is arranged that Heidi should return to the mountains. Together she and her friend Peter, the goat-herd, achieve wondrous changes in the community in which they live.</p><p>Johanna Spyri's classic story of a young orphan sent to live with her grumpy grandfather in the Swiss Alps is retold in it's entirety in this beautifully bound hardcover edition. <i>Heidi</i> has charmed and intrigued readers since it's original publication in 1880. Much more than a children's story, the narrative is also a lesson on the precarious nature of freedom, a luxury too often taken for granted. Heidi almost loses her liberty as she is ripped away from the tranquility of the mountains to tend to a sick cousin in the city. Happily, all's well that ends well, and the reader is left with only warm, fuzzy thoughts. Spryi's story will never grow wearisome--and this is a very appealing edition. <i>--Naomi Gesinger</i>6 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Language of Clothes</h2><p>Alison Lurie, the Pulitzer Prize - winning novelist, is our savvy guide and interpreter on this tour through the history of fashion, providing unique insights into how changing sex roles, political upheavals, and class structure have influenced costume.

Roberto Bolano<p></p><b><p></p></b><p></p>What happens after the bombs drop? This is the troubling question Philip K. Dick addresses with <i>Dr. Bloodmoney, or How We Got Along After the Bomb</i>. It is the story of a world reeling from the effects of nuclear annihilation and fallout, a world where mutated humans and animals are the norm, and the scattered survivors take comfort from a disc jockey endlessly circling the globe in a broken-down satellite. And hidden amongst the survivors is Dr. Bloodmoney himself, the man responsible for it all. This bizarre cast of characters cajole, seduce, and backstab in their attempts to get ahead in what is left of the world, consequences and casualties be damned. A sort of companion to <i>Dr. Strangelove</i>, an unofficial and unhinged sequel, Dick s novel is just as full of dark comedy and just as chilling. <p></p><p></p><b><p></p></b><p>PHILIP K. DICK (1928 1982) wrote 121 short stories and 45 novels and is considered one of the most visionary authors of the twentieth century.

Eleven works have been adapted to film, including <i>Blade Runner</i> (based on <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i>), <i>Total Recall</i>, <i>Minority Report</i>, and <i>A Scanner Darkly</i>."</p><b>Dr. Bloodmoney</b> is a post-nuclear-holocaust masterpiece filled with a host of Dick?s most memorable characters: Hoppy Harrington, a deformed mutant with telekinetic powers; Walt Dangerfield, a selfless disc jockey stranded in a satellite circling the globe; Dr. Bluthgeld, the megalomaniac physicist largely responsible for the decimated state of the world; and Stuart McConchie and Bonnie Keller, two unremarkable people bent the survival of goodness in a world devastated by evil.

Even her late husband treated her more as a companion than a lover when she accompanied him to war. But Sophia hopes to enjoy a Season in London as her niece makes her social debut&#x2014;until, that is, her hopes are dashed when she is faced with a threat she can reveal to no one. Then she meets Sir Nathaniel Gascoigne, an old army friend, and falls in love with him even as she must discourage his growing passion for her. Nathaniel can sense Sophia's unhappiness and fear, but does not understand that his attempts to protect and help her can only bring about her downfall...</p><p>Mary Balogh reconfirms her reputation as a superlative writer of Regency romance in this well-drawn, ultimately moving love story between a war hero's widow and her longtime friend. Nathaniel Gascoigne knew Sophie as a colleague's supportive wife when he fought in the Peninsular War. Now, meeting the widowed Sophie in London after a long separation, Nat is surprised by her unexpected agreement that they share discreet lovemaking, no strings attached. But a secret involving Sophie's former marriage has left her vulnerable to a blackmailer, and just when the satisfaction she offers to Nat makes him most eager to prolong their dalliance, Sophie decides she has no choice but to break it off. Nat's gradual insights into Sophie's character, and the couple's struggles to act honorably yet remain true to themselves, are beautifully handled. As a delightful contrast, there's the barbed repartee between Nat's independent-minded cousin and his marriage-shy best friend, which develops into a witty and satisfying secondary romance. Balogh's masterful command of the Regency period, and her skill at dramatizing subtle nuances of character, endow her books with rare and rich rewards. <i>--Ellen Edwards</i><p><b>Mary Balogh</b> has written more than one hundred historical novels and novellas, more than thirty of which have been <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers.

This is an OCR edition with typos. Excerpt from book: Marathon paid religious rites to them ; and orators solemnly invoked them in their most impassioned adjurations before the assembled men of Athens. &#34; Nothing was omitted that could keep alive the remembrance of a deed which had first taught the Athenian people to know its own strength, by measuring it with the power which had subdued the greater part of the known world. The consciousness thus awakened fixed its character, its station, and its destiny; it was the spring of its later great actions and ambitious enterprises.&#34; It was not indeed by one defeat, however signal, that the pride of Persia could be broken, and her dreams of universal empire dispelled. Ten years afterward she renewed her attempts upon Europe on a grander scale of enterprise, and was repulsed by Greece with greater and reiterated loss. Larger forces and heavier slaughter than had been seen at Marathon signalized the conflicts of Greeks and Persians at Artemisium, Salamis, Plataea, and the Eurymedon. But, mighty and momentous as these battles were, they rank not with Marathon in importance. They originated no new impulse. They turned back no current of fate. They were merely confirmatory of the already existing bias which Marathon had created. The day of Marathon is the critical epoch in the history of the two nations. It broke forever the spell of Persian invincibility, which had previously paralyzed men&#39;s minds. It generated among the Greeks the spirit which heat back Xerxes, and afterward led on Xenophon, Agesilaus, and Alexander, in terrible retaliation through their Asiatic campaigns. It secured for mankind the intellectual treasures of Athens, the growth of free institutions, the liberal enlightenment of the Western world, and the gradual ascendency for many ages of the great principles of European civ...</p><p></p><h2>Kimono: A Modern History</h2><p><p>What is the kimono? Everyday garment? Art object? Symbol of Japan? As this book shows, the kimono has served all of these roles, its meaning changing across time and with the perspective of the wearer or viewer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Kimono: A Modern History</i> begins by exposing the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century foundations of the modern kimono fashion industry. It explores the crossover between &#x2018;art&#x2019; and &#x2018;fashion&#x2019; in this period at the hands of famous Japanese painters who worked with clothing pattern books and painted directly onto garments. With Japan&#x2019;s exposure to Western fashion in the nineteenth century, and Westerners&#x2019; exposure to Japanese modes of dress and design, the kimono took on new associations and came to symbolize an exotic culture and an alluring female form. In the aftermath of the Second World War, the kimono industry was sustained through government support. The line between fashion and art became blurred as kimonos produced by famous designers were collected for their beauty and displayed in museums, rather than being worn as clothing. Today, the kimono has once again taken on new dimensions, as the Internet and social media proliferate images of the kimono as a versatile garment to be integrated into a range of individual styles.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Kimono: A Modern History</i>, the inspiration for a major exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York,<i></i>not only tells the story of a distinctive garment&#x2019;s ever-changing functions and image, but provides a novel perspective on Japan&#x2019;s modernization and encounter with the West.</p></p><p><b>Terry Satsuki Milhaupt</b> (1959&#x2013;2012) was an independent art historian based in New York, a guest curator and an internationally recognized expert on Japanese textiles.

Punk</h2><p><i>Under the Big Black Sun</i> explores the nascent Los Angeles punk rock movement and its evolution to hardcore punk as it's never been told before. Authors John Doe and Tom DeSavia have woven together an enthralling story of the legendary West Coast scene from 1977-1982 by enlisting the voices of people who were there. The book shares chapter-length tales from the authors along with personal essays from famous (and infamous) players in the scene. Additional authors include: Exene Cervenka (X), Henry Rollins (Black Flag), Mike Watt (The Minutemen), Jane Wiedlin and Charlotte Caffey (Go-Go's), Dave Alvin (The Blasters), Chris D.

Through interstitial commentary, John Doe "narrates" this journey through the land of film noir sunshine, Hollywood back alleys, and suburban sprawl, the place where he met his artistic counterparts Exene, DJ Bonebrake, and Billy Zoom and formed X, the band that became synonymous with, and in many ways defined, L.A. punk.<br><br>Focusing on punk's evolutionary years, <i>Under the Big Black Sun</i> shares stories of friendship and love, ambition and feuds, grandiose dreams and cultural rage, all combined with the tattered, glossy sheen of pop culture weirdness that epitomized the operations of Hollywood's underbelly.

The series demonstrates the importance of African history from earliest pre-history, through the establishment of its ancient civilizations to the placing of Africa in the context of world history. The growth and development of African historiography, once written records became more common, document the triumph of Islam, the extension of trading relations, cultural exchanges and human contacts, as well as the impact and consequences of the slave trade. The European scramble for colonial territory in the 1880s is examined with a focus on the responses of Africans themselves to the economic and social aspects of colonial systems up to 1935, including the growth of anti-colonial movements and the strengthening of African political nationalism. The contributions document how the continent moved from international conflict under foreign domination to struggles for political sovereignty and economic independence. The last (unabridged) volume 8 examines the challenges of nation-building and the socio-cultural changes affecting the newly independent nations. The series is co-published in Africa with seven publishers, in the United States and Canada by the University of California Press, and in association with the UNESCO Press.</p><p></p><h2>The Fire within the Eye</h2><p><p>In <i>The Fire within the Eye</i>, scientist and author David Park helps us reconceive the everyday phenomenon of light in profound ways, from spiritual meanings embedded in our culture to the challenging questions put forth by great scientists and philosophers. Park, who is both a gifted teacher and physicist, takes us on a tour through history spanning ancient Greek, Neoplatonic, and Arabic philosophy together with astrology, the metaphysics of Galileo and Kepler, and the role of mathematics and experimentation in modern physics. By creatively synthesizing a broad sweep of historical events and intellectual movements around the theme of light, the author offers readers of all backgrounds a unique perspective on Western civilization itself. Readers will find themselves immersed in lively discussions conducted by a physicist equally at home exploring the invention of perspective by Brunelleschi and Alberti, the writings of Goethe, or the mathematical models inspiring Maxwell's electromagnetic theory.</p><br><p>Plato made light the earthly counterpart of the Good; the early Christians believed the command "Let there be light" unleashed a power that shaped and energized the world. Park follows the connotations of spirituality and power attributed to light in religion, philosophy, art, and literature. At the same time he enables us truly to feel the excitement surrounding scientific discoveries and debates about the nature of light throughout history --Isaac Newton's scientific explanation of color and the raging battles between proponents of light as particles and light as a wave. Park traces the attempts to define light, beginning in the nineteenth century with the proposal that light is a wave motion in a field that unites electricity and magnetism. How this theory was reconciled with the particle theory of light is one of many paradoxes that Park guides us in understanding.</p><br><p>Park writes eloquently of the physical, aesthetic, and spiritual aspects of light, making this book an invaluable guide for all readers wishing to explore the fascinating relationship between science and culture.</p></p><p>Light, like the air we breathe, is one of those invisible qualities that most of us only think about when the power goes off and there are no batteries in the flashlight. But ask yourself just what it <i>is</i>, and suddenly light becomes a puzzle indeed. Is light a <i>thing</i>? Is it, as Aristotle claimed, an accident? Physicist David Park covers all the bases in <i>The Fire Within the Eye</i>, his fascinating exploration of the history of light. All the heavy-hitters show up here--Aristotle, Galileo, Archimedes, and Max Planck--but there are also plenty of names the average reader might not recognize, such as the 10th-century Iraqi Abu Ali al-Hasan, who suggested that the objects we see are tiny reproductions of the real thing imprinted on the lenses of our eyes. <p>Park takes the reader from the earliest theories of Aristotle (light is an accident) to the most recent hypotheses (light is like both a wave and a particle), and he does it in prose that is highly readable. If by the end of <i>The Fire Within the Eye</i> you still don't understand exactly what light is, don't worry: David Park is less interested in defining it than in describing how our perceptions of it have changed over the millennia.</p><p>"David Park's passion for science and the history of his topic comes across on every page and is infectious. Greek, early modern, and modern science come alive in a book full of delightful information."<b>--Sylvan Schweber, author of<i>QED and the Men Who Made It</i></b></p></p><h2>10 Ten-Minute Stories</h2><p>A naughty puppet, a flying horse and a sorcerer?s apprentice are just some of the characters you?ll meet in tales from all over the world.

Beginning in the 1930s, The Holocaust describes the conditions in Germany that led to Hitler's rise to power and the Nazi policy of destruction. But at the heart of The Holocaust are the acts of courage and resistance, the stories of the men and women (young and old, Jewish and Gentile) who fought against Hitler and the Nazis and kept the spirit of heritage of the Jews alive in this devastating period. The Holocaust is an especially ideal introduction for young readers to a difficult subject, a tragic time, and the heroism that emerged from the ashes of despair. --<i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>Big Ideas MATH, Geometry, Texas Edition, 9781608408153, 1608408159</h2><p>Geometry Textbook for high school, Texas edition</p><p></p><h2>Milking the Moon: A Southerner&#39;s Story of Life on This Planet</h2><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve had a great life, and it all happened because I didn&#x2019;t plan any of it.&#x201d;<br>-- Eugene Walter<br><br>Eugene Walter was the best-known man you&#x2019;ve never heard of. In his 76 years, he ate of &#x201c;the ripened heart of life,&#x201d; to quote a letter from Isak Dinesen, one of his many illustrious friends. He savored the porch life of his native Mobile, Alabama, in the 1920s and &#x2019;30s. He stumbled into the Greenwich Village art scene in late-1940s New York. He was a ubiquitous presence in Paris&#x2019;s expatriate caf� society in the 1950s, where he was part of the Paris Review at its inception. Perhaps most remarkably of all for a poor Southern boy, he spent the 1960s in Rome, where he participated in the golden age of Italian cinema&#x2013;including a role in Fellini&#x2019;s 8 1?2&#x2013;and entertained some of the most famous people in the world.<br><br>As recorded by Katherine Clark toward the end of Walter&#x2019;s life, his story&#x2013;enlivened with personal glimpses of luminaries from William Faulkner and Martha Graham to Judy Garland and Leontyne Price&#x2013;is an eyewitness history of the heart of the last century and a pitch-perfect addition to the Southern literary tradition. Most of all, this sumptuous oral biography conveys the spirit and charm of a truly unique American who defied the odds and authority, embarked on life, and went wherever his fancy and whimsy led him.<br><br>&#x201c;Whenever I found myself in the presence of Eugene Walter, I thought that everyone&#x2019;s life could be turned into a work of art. His was. Eugene Walter was a prince of whimsy and magic, and he turned his daily world upside down and made it elfin, cat-haunted, and hilarious. He could snap his fingers, and art would fall out all over the place. Milking the Moon has perfect pitch and flawlessly captures Eugene&#x2019;s pixilated wonderland of a life. I am so grateful to Katherine Clark for the job she has done, for bringing this incredible man&#x2019;s story to the page with such wit, panache, and style. I love this book&#x2013;I couldn&#x2019;t put it down!&#x201d;&#x2013;Pat Conroy<br><br>&#x201c;Truman Capote lied to harm others; Eugene Walter, sometimes known as the other Capote, the good one, lied only to delight others.&#x201d;&#x2013;Gore Vidal<br><br>&#x201c;Eugene Walter held the nearest thing to a salon; he was an unofficial reception committee and all roads led to him.&#x201d;&#x2013;Muriel Spark<br><br>&#x201c;Eugene Walter is one of those personages who turn up in life and leave, well, an indelible impression in which all personal characteristics&#x2013;manner, speech, dress, and so on&#x2013; are memorably distinctive.&#x201d;&#x2013;George Plimpton, from the Foreword</p><p>When Katherine Clark began interviewing Eugene Walter (1921-98) in 1991 for an oral biography of this Mobile, Alabama, legend's picaresque life, friends asked her, "Do you think he will tell you the truth?" "I certainly hope not!" she replied. Clark, herself a Southerner, understood that the charm of Walter's conversation came from his brilliantly polished stories, in which "at a certain point the actual gives way to the apocryphal." So readers shouldn't ask if Tallulah Bankhead really gave Walter three pubic hairs or if Anna Magnani actually asked the mayor of Rome to help find Walter's lost cat: that's not the point. These anecdotes express Walter's appreciation of people he likes, and although the narrative is stuffed with famous names from Truman Capote to Leontyne Price, the exuberant protagonist finds less celebrated folks just as fascinating. His loving evocation of Mobile in the 1920s, when the front porch was the center of all social life, is just as detailed as his portraits of sojourns in more glamorous enclaves: Greenwich Village after World War II ("where I could sit in the evenings and hear Jane and Paul Bowles quarreling in their nearby apartment"); Paris in the early 1950s (his short story "Troubador" appeared in the first issue of <i>Paris Review</i>); and Rome during its <i>La Dolce Vita</i> years. Walter refused Fellini's plea that he perform with his marionettes in that particular movie, but he played an American journalist in <i>8 1/2</i> and "must have been in over a hundred of those crazy Italian films" before returning to Mobile in 1979. ("Sooner or later all Southerners come home, not to die, but to eat gumbo.") Clark, who captured an Alabama midwife's wisdom in <i>Motherwit</i>, gets out of her subject's way and lets his words create an enchanting world in this marvelously entertaining reminiscence. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>&#x201c;Amazing...We owe Katherine Clark an incalculable debt. ...Not since John Kennedy Toole&#x2019;s <b>A Confederacy of Dunces</b> has a book come from so completely out of the blue to give me so much pleasure.&#x201d; &#x2014;Jonathan Yardley, <i>Washington Post</i><br><br>&#x201c;Katherine Clark . . . has edited Eugene Walter&#x2019;s oral history into a book as amazing as the man himself.&#x201d; &#x2014;Jonathan Yardley, <i>Washington Post Book World</i><br><br>&#x201c;<b>Milking the Moon</b> has perfect pitch and flawlessly captures Eugene&#x2019;s pixilated wonderland of a life. . . .

The keys to habit change is what this book delivers.&nbsp;It explains why the difference between those who are successful and everyone else is not found in differences in intelligence, talent, or work ethic; but rather in habits.&nbsp; It explores why habits are so powerful and how we can harness this power to reach our God-given potential and obtain a higher degree of success.

When he was sixteen, his family made the decision to flee to the United States&#x2014;they were among the last German Jews to escape, in 1938.<br> &nbsp;<br> In America, Freddy tried enlisting the day after Pearl Harbor, only to be rejected as an &#x201c;enemy alien&#x201d; because he was German. He was soon recruited to the OSS, the country&#x2019;s first spy outfit before the CIA. Freddy, joined by Dutch Jewish refugee Hans Wynberg and Nazi defector Franz Weber, parachuted into Austria as the leader of Operation Greenup, meant to deter Hitler&#x2019;s last stand. He posed as a Nazi officer and a French POW for months, dispatching reports to the OSS via Hans, holed up with a radio in a nearby attic. The reports contained a goldmine of information, provided key intelligence about the Battle of the Bulge, and allowed the Allies to bomb twenty Nazi trains. On the verge of the Allied victory, Freddy was captured by the Gestapo and tortured and waterboarded for days. Remarkably, he persuaded the Nazi commander for the region to surrender, completing one of the most successful OSS missions of the war.<br><br> Based on years of research and interviews with Mayer himself, whom the author was able to meet only months before his death at the age of ninety-four, <i>Return to the Reich </i>is an eye-opening, unforgettable narrative of World War II heroism.</p><p><p>ERIC LICHTBLAU is a Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning investigative reporter in the Washington bureau of the <i>New York Times</i> and has written about legal, political, and national security issues in the capital since 1999.

One of the most distinguished and prolific medical historians of the day, Porter had recently taken early retirement from the Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at University College London when, in the spring of 2002, he collapsed while riding his bicycle and died at the age of 55. This book, alas, will be his last. (Figure) And what a book it is. Porter takes us on a romp through the long 18th century, exploring ideas about health and disease, ruminations about the soul and what awaits us after death, reflections on the declining role of religion, and conceptions of the relationship between the human mind and the body in which it resides. After an early chapter devoted to the time of Hippocrates and Galen, this lively and erudite book centers on English sources, both familiar and little known, from the Glorious Revolution of 1688 to the rise of Romanticism in the 1800s. Readers should not expect a single, linear path of argument. Instead, Porter combines a broad set of questions with fine-grained detail about the day-to-day world his many subjects embodied in some instances and created in others. He gives us particularly insightful readings of autobiographies and first-person novels that are "preoccupied with the relations between the body and the consciousness belonging to it." His careful, innovative analysis of a wide range of sources alerts us not only to what is present but also to what has been omitted. Even though there is an 80-page, double-columned bibliography, Porter's death meant that his editors were not able to locate the precise editions from which the numerous quotations were taken. There is much here for readers of the Journal. We learn about the creation of dividing lines that today are taken for granted; some founders of modern science, for example, tried hard to prove the supernatural through science. We read about debates over whether the mind can exist without the body and how the mind can divert attention from the ailments of the flesh. Porter gives us much detail (perhaps more than some readers would want) about the travails of the flesh in the 18th century. The Earl of Shaftesbury was troubled at the dawn of that century by the "squalor of snot," and he debated with Bernard de Mandeville, a physician-satirist who grappled willingly with the realities of the flesh and its many emanations. But both men, like others of the day, put aside the religious emphasis on managing the body that had characterized earlier learned discussions. As religion receded in relevance, clergymen gave way to physicians at the bedside in the management of death. Some aspects of the world that Porter describes presage issues and customs of the 21st century. Santorio Santorio, who did early work on the thermometer, lived in a balance machine, weighing his intake and output, measuring, measuring everything. He was followed a century later by Lord Byron, an exercise fanatic who mastered his body through a regimen so rigorous that not an ounce of excess flesh remained. Corpulence became undesirable, the slim look became popular, and long before our current understanding of obesity took root, a cult of thinness had developed, from which we have not yet emerged. Eighteenth-century critics shared our contemporary concern about overpopulation. William Godwin trusted individuals to solve the problem, believing that as medicine enabled people to live forever, sexual urges would abate and reproduction would thus cease. Perhaps the most poignant part of this book comes in Porter's discussion of the great historian and autobiographer Edward Gibbon, author of the classic, six-volume Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Gibbon suffered from a whole host of painful and obvious ailments. But those ailments were merely of the body, subordinate to the life of the enlightened mind. Gibbon did not believe in an immortal soul, but he hoped that his Memoirs would mean that "one day his mind [would] be familiar to the grandchildren of those who are yet unborn." As Porter observed, "His mind will thus live on" through his immortal words. One could make the same observation for the words of Roy Porter, and for that we all should be very thankful. <i>Joel D.

He'd never thought he'd miss how cold it got in Stanley, or Grand Forks, North Dakota, either. That was another place he considered home after spending half his childhood there. But it was rarely anything but hot-and wet-in Baalkpan, the capital city of the new Union he'd helped build. The daily shower had finally passed and he and his wife, Karen, the assistant minister of medicine, stepped outside the main entrance to the Allied Naval Hospital east of the Great Hall. That was Karen's principal domain, and between her long hours and his crazy schedule, Alan sometimes gloomily suspected their little daughter, Allison Verdia, was the only child they'd ever get the chance to make. But at least he could see his "youngling" and "mate," which was a hell of a lot more than most could say these days. So many younglings had at least one parent deployed, sometimes both. Alan tried to prevent the latter, but that had been a losing proposition from the start. Lemurians made no distinction between sexes when it came to military service, and that was probably the only reason they'd had the numbers to survive. But new regulations decreed that pregnant females returned home, period, and he tried to keep them as trainers as long as possible.<br><br> Even so, there were a lot of orphans running around. The youngest went entirely naked, scampering about on all fours as often as not, their frizzy tails held high. A pack of them dashed through a puddle, splashing water and mud, before rocketing up a heavy wooden pier supporting an old-style aboveground structure built in the time before genuine fortifications protected the city from large predators-and invading Grik. The younglings flowed through a window, raising alarmed, angry voices, then skittered down another pier to vanish in the bustle of the city. Alan laughed at the sight, but supposed it wasn't really funny. Lemurian younglings were boisterous by nature and their antics were well tolerated by adults. In the past, however, they'd been equally well supervised. That was no longer the case, and they now ran in packs almost as wild as Griklets. Alan tried to be philosophical about it. At least they didn't swarm all over people and eat them like Griklets. But even as they were losing an entire generation to the war, Alan feared they might lose the next one, too. Culturally, at least.<br><br> "Mind your shoes," Karen scolded, as Alan carefully negotiated the planks laid down to the paalka-drawn carriage outside the hospital. "And at least try to keep from making mud pies in your best whites! Maybe I don't have to clean them anymore"-she flapped her own clean but dark-stained apron for emphasis-"but somebody does. And it's a chore nobody needs!"<br><br> Alan had been caught by the rain while visiting wounded 'Cats and men; something he did every week. And he didn't mind that the deluge had delayed his busy schedule, heartrending as it often was to speak with the shattered victims of this terrible war, or simply view those who couldn't even hear him. It also filled him with hope that, despite their pain, so many Lemurians-and humans from the Empire of the New Britain Isles, for the most part-remained so dedicated to the cause. Indeed, most were eager to return to the fight, regardless of how . . . unlikely that might be in many cases. They'll get back in somehow, Alan promised himself-as he'd promised them-even if they never see the front again. We need instructors, engineers, and shop foremen who've been at the pointy end and seen what works. We may've lost their direct combat skills, but we can't afford to lose their experience. God knows we need them.<br><br> "I'll try," Alan assured, stepping into the carriage and nodding at the 'Cat Marine on the front seat, holding the reins. The Lemurian made a curious chirping sound and whipped the reins. Moaning rebelliously, the paalka squished forward. Alan swayed, still looking at Karen and the hospital behind her. The hospital wasn't as large as the great factories now crowding the Baalkpan waterfront, once so charming with colorful, bustling bazaars and brisk commerce, but it was the biggest building past the Great Hall, in Baalkpan proper. That was a source of pride, as well as sadness. It said a lot about how committed "his" people were to helping those who served them. His expression turned stony then, because as much as his visits to the hospital inspired him, they also renewed his resolve to exact vengeance against those who'd caused so much suffering in the first place. All of them, he secretly swore, with a fresh stab of furious grief over the sinking of SMS Amerika, and two- thirds of the wounded she carried, by the shadowy League of Tripoli. Some of Amerika's survivors had finally reached Baalkpan, and between their accounts and what Matt sent from Grik City, they had a better idea of what happened-and of what the League was, even if its motives remained obscure. Three wars now? Alan mused grimly. No, not yet. Not if we can help it. We can barely handle the two we've got. But there'll be a reckoning.<br><br> "And put on your hat!" Karen admonished, raising her voice and gesturing at the sky. The sun was stabbing through the clouds, raising steam from the sodden ground. Alan Letts had a very fair complexion and burned easily. He didn't spend as much time outdoors these days and sometimes forgot to protect himself.<br><br> "Yes, dear," he called back dutifully, quickly adjusting his high, tight collar and plopping the white hat on his head. "I'll see you and the girls tonight," he added, finally sitting as the carriage lurched onto the main, gravel-mixed street. For all the younglings running loose, even more had been adopted by females working in the shipyards or factories, both Lemurians and expat Imperial women. Some families with the wherewithal, still intact because they ran businesses essential to the war effort and weren't allowed to fight, had adopted half a dozen or more. Alan and Karen had taken two themselves, both female, and treated them as their own. They would've taken more, but their duties already required that they have a nanny-a young, one-armed Marine veteran of the Battle of Raan-goon named Unaa-Saan-Mar-with three younglings of her own. For the first time, he noticed the many furry Lemurian faces watching from the newly built ground-level shops and porches lining the road, their amused but respectful blinking still coming as a surprise.<br><br> They actually enjoy that I'm henpecked! He realized with a mental snort. Then he reconsidered. But maybe that's why they've accepted me. It makes me more a person to them, regardless of what . . . species I am. Alan still found his official status as the leader of the new, wildly diverse nation they'd built a bit overwhelming, and more than a little unbelievable. True, he'd been accepted as acting chairman during Adar's absence, and the members of the Grand Alliance, including the Empire of the New Britain Isles and the Republic of Real People, which hadn't joined the Union, were accustomed to that. He even thought he'd done a good job, under the circumstances, managing the logistical side of the war effort in particular. But he'd never dreamed he'd be practically drafted into the job for real, after Adar fell into enemy hands.<br><br> It might've been easier to understand if he'd just been acclaimed High Chief of Baalkpan. He was well-known there, and even-as were all his surviving shipmates from USS Walker, USS Mahan, and S-19, to various degrees-beloved. They'd saved the city, after all. But the fact they'd also, literally or by extension, saved Aryaal, B'mbaado, B'taava, North Borno, Sembaakpan, Sular, Austraal, Chill-Chaap, the Shogunate of Yokohama (which included the tragic village of Ani-Aaki), and all the Filpin Lands-not to mention the eleven seagoing Homes that had joined the Union-apparently hadn't been lost on anyone. Though still amazingly fractious (particularly in the case of Sular, which still argued over representation after all the seagoing Homes joined as a single, relatively high-population state), the various Homes had apparently recognized the validity of some version of the old axiom "Never change horses in the middle of the stream." Or war.<br><br> It also probably helped that Alan came from the one Home or Clan that every other had to materially support and considered most impartial: the "Amer-i-caan Navy Clan." It not only protected everyone, but most of its members now came from every clan or Home. They swore allegiance to its flag and a constitution that had served as a guide for the one adopted by the Union, but though their loyalty to its high chief-Captain Matthew Reddy-was unquestioned, everyone knew they remained loyal to the United Homes as well. In addition, every Union warship belonged to the Amer-i-caan Navy Clan except those designated as reserve, such as Salaama-Na or Salissa (CV-1), and an increasing number of auxiliaries entering service. It was no longer required that all sailors join the Amer-i-caan Navy Clan forever, but officers must in order to be commissioned. Regular sailors' oaths would be allowed to expire (if they wanted) when the war was over and they went home. But the Marines practically belonged to Captain Reddy. The Navy Clan also had a few land possessions, such as the islands of Tarakaan, Midway, and Andamaan. And there was a "daughter" colony being built at a place it called Saan Diego, so far away that it was literally on the bottom of the world as far as most were concerned. Even that didn't cause disputes, because all contributed solely to the maintenance of the navy and would never become independent Homes.<br><br> Alan often wondered to himself if the mishmash they'd put together would survive the war. He also worried that the unusual powers he'd helped reserve for the Navy Clan might be abused by some future high chief after they were gone. He hoped not. He hoped the tradition of selfless service Matt and the others had established at such a terrible cost would last a very long time. Either way, though, for now at least, the Amer-i-caan Navy Clan-as the one most responsible for the conduct of the war-had to remain a very slight "first among equals," even as it truly was viewed as the most neutral when it came to disputes among other Homes.<br><br> He stuck two fingers in the collar at his neck and pulled. Damn thing's getting tighter as I sweat! he grumped to himself. What the hell was wrong with my khakis? It was his wife's idea that he always wear his best whites in public. Despite his complaints, he supposed it made sense. He was the chairman-practically president, for God's sake!-after all. He should try to look the part. And at least whites don't show sweat like khakis, he conceded. But maybe most important, the uniform's a good recruiting tool. We need more people than ever to crew the ships and fly the planes we're building, and fill the ranks of our armies.<br><br> Conscription had been instituted in the Empire of the New Britain Isles, and now in the Republic of Real People as well. But nothing like that had been proposed in the Homes forming the new Union simply because, once the war practically surrounded them, there was no place left for "runaways" to go. Particularly after the battles of Aryaal and Baalkpan. That was when it was driven brutally home that there weren't any noncombatants and it became understood that every person, male or female, capable of bearing arms and living under the protection of the Alliance from the Malay Barrier to the Filpin Lands, was a member of a local guard. Even factory workers attended daily drill sessions (usually at work) and fell in for larger unit instruction once a month in the open killing grounds beyond the ever-expanding earthen walls protecting the cities. Armories stocked with old-style muskets were conveniently situated and factory and yard workers were assigned defensive positions close to where they worked.<br><br> That was all well and good, but though anyone was theoretically subject to being called up and sent to an Advanced Training Center and assigned to a building regiment, or shipped off to replace casualties, it almost never happened. They needed workers as badly as troops. The addition of the Great South Isle, or Austraal, to the Union would help a great deal-eventually. The populous Homes there had remained an untapped reservoir of potential sailors, soldiers, and labor for most of the war. Now they were in it, and though most had to stay and build their own factories and defend their cities, many wanted to fight for their people-and their new nation. Getting them here-or anywhere-was a major problem, however. The Allied sea-lift capacity was stretched to the breaking point, supplying forces in the east and west, halfway around the world. And Austraal didn't have the same nautical mind-set of other Homes in the Union. Their huge island was lush and fertile (on this world) and never depended as much on the sea. They had a few decent shipyards, but it was taking time for them to gear up-and there was no point in building more old-style ships like they were used to, in any event. They'd agreed to focus on heavy haulers and auxiliaries, based on the hull design of the Scott class steam frigates, but half again as big. In the meantime, Allied seagoing Homes ponderously freighted steam engines down to Austraal shipyards, and just as tediously returned with loads of volunteers. Alan considered it his duty to, by example, get those recruits to choose the Navy or Marines. Besides, he thought, wearing the uniform lets me remind everyone that I belong to the Amer-i-caan Navy Clan, and, chairman or not, whether I currently outrank him or not, Captain Reddy's still my high chief.<br><br> The carriage slowed as it passed the growing military cemetery on the shady grounds surrounding the Great Hall, and finally stopped. The Great Hall was once supported high in the air by the massive Galla tree growing up within it, but had "expanded" down to the ground. Alan was running late for his rendezvous with Lord Bolton Forester, ambassador from the Empire of the New Britain Isles, but the tall, gray-haired man with a huge mustache stood from a bench on the hall's porch and smiled up at Alan. Forester's aide, Lieutenant Bachman, had been pacing on the carefully fitted timbers, watched by a relatively short and wiry, and also apparently amused, man named Henry Stokes. Stokes had been a leading seaman aboard HMAS Perth, and was now Director of the Office of Strategic Intelligence (OSI). Alan remained in the carriage as a pair of Lemurian Marines escorted the men to join him, ready to assist them up if necessary.</p><h2>Shock and Vibration Handbook</h2><p>Chapters are grouped according to subject matter.

Constructive is a good thing, but wallowing is bad. Right? But wait a minute; is it really so terrible to give ourselves a time-out to feel our feelings? Or is it possible that wallowing is an act of loving kindness, right when we need it most? Almost everyone loves the idea of self-compassion _ the notion that maybe in spite of our messy emotions and questionable behavior, we really aren&#39;t all that bad. In recent years there&#39;s been an explosion of books that encourage readers to stop beating themselves up for being human, which is terrific. Unfortunately, readers who aren&#39;t interested in Buddhism or meditation have been left out in the cold. Constructive Wallowing is the first book to cut right to the chase, bypassing descriptions of Eastern philosophy and meditation techniques to teach readers how to accept and feel their feelings with self-compassion for greater emotional health. It&#39;s tempting to turn away from menacing, uncomfortable feelings like anger, grief, or regret; however, ignoring them just seems to make them stick around. By learning to accept and embrace, difficult feelings, readers keep their sense of personal power and gain greater understanding and ultimately esteem for themselves.</p><p></p><h2>Y si quieres saber de mi pasado (Spanish Edition)</h2><p>Muse to poets and screenwriters, Vargas lived the golden era of Mexico.

Nick Butterworth and Mick Inkpen (Knight Books)</h2><p>A modern classic by the best-selling creators of Percy the Park Keeper and Kipper celebrating that great tradition: The Nativity Play.</p><p>Mick Inkpen (Author) Mick Inkpen has been a bestselling children&#39;s author for over 25 years. He is one of today&#39;s most popular picture book author/illustrators and the famous creator of both Kipper and Wibbly Pig. Mick has won the Children&#39;s Book Award for Threadbear and the British Book Award twice, for Penguin Small and Lullabyhullaballoo. Kipper won a BAFTA for Best Animated Film. Nick Butterworth (Author) After leaving school Nick Butterworth went to work as a typographic designer and formed a partnership with Mick Inkpen. Nick&#39;s books have sold over 12 million copies around the world in more than 25 languages. He has won several prestigious awards including the Nestle Gold Award for The Whisperer.

The sweet, funny story is illustrated perfectly by brightly colored scenes of feverish activity. Boys and girls, their teacher and Mums are busy preparing for the pageant at school where all the children will have a star turn. Sam's mother soothes his fears that he'll forget his lines while she sews together the striped towels for his shepherd's costume. Tracy's mother has to remind the girl she's to be an angel, not a fairy; carrying a wand is out. At last, on the big night, the old, ever-new events are reenacted to the approval of all. Never mind a lost beard, or one actor's slipping out of character to wave to Dad in the audience. The teacher, the guests, the custodians beam with pleasure as the lights come up full on stage and the entire cast assembles for the grand finale. Mary, Joseph, Jesus and the Kings join angels, shepherds, camel, cow, donkey and sheep to sing a resounding "Hark! the herald angels sing." <br>Copyright 1985 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Killing Kindness: Dalziel &amp; Pascoe #5 (Volume 5)</h2><p>Andy Dalziel knows how to cope with crime.

He has been a professional historian since 1973 and has written eighteen books, including The City of London, a widely acclaimed four-volume history, and WG&#39;s Birthday Party, an account of the Gentleman v. Players match at Lord&#39;s in July 1898. He is the author of Austerity Britain, 1945-51 and Family Britain, 1951-57, the first two titles in a series of books covering the history of post-war Britain (1945-79) under the collective title &#39;Tales of a New Jerusalem&#39;. He is currently a visiting professor at Kingston University.Triumphant ... A historian of peerless sensitivity and curiosity about the lives of individuals. His method is to immerse first himself, then his readers, in a deep quotidian fabric of the time, making every strand visible before gradually lifting his gaze and revealing the wider pattern * <b><i>Financial Times</i></b> * He compresses the vivid fragments so that a subtle but irresistible narrative emerges from them: more mosaic, perhaps, than collage ... Kynaston skilfully balances accounts of the damp, stink and filth of the old slums (and the desire to escape) with the haughty certainties of the planners and - very quickly - the unhappy reality of the change forced upon millions * <b>Andrew Marr, <i>New Statesman</i></b> * David Kynaston's social history of post-war Britain is an an accessible, humane, illuminating and entirely admirable project, a riveting description of a country changing month by month, like a complicated but deeply loveable person. Kynaston takes everything that is important to us - politics, labour relations, sport, television, literature, the weather - and turns it all into the definitive story of who we are and how we got that way. I adore these books * <b>Nick Hornby</b> * This compelling history of the nation is wise, funny, impeccably researched and beautifully written ... Not for one second does his writing sag under the weight of his research: if you asked him to plod, he simply wouldn't know how ... This latest volume will be every bit as addictive as its predecessors ... Like a great composer, Kynaston dots little melodies into the opening minutes which he later allows to swell into major themes ... The best way to review this book would be to take a leaf from Lewis Carroll and map it all out, word for word. As it is, you'll just have to save me the effort by reading it for yourself * <b>Craig Brown, <i>Mail on Sunday</i></b> * Richly detailed series ... Indefatigable, judicious, with a magpie's eye for detail and a lovely grasp of tone and balance, David Kynaston is one of the great chroniclers of our modern story ... Every paragraph contains some glittering nugget * <b><i>Sunday Times</i></b> * An exciting read, containing moments of suspense and lengthy sections of analysis ... Kynaston's book makes salutary and urgent reading, suggesting that we might do well to live with half an eye on the Kynastons of the future * <b>Lara Feigel, <i>Observer</i></b> * He is chewing his way through the giant lettuce-leaf of his chosen decades like a particularly thorough tortoise. Hares: watch out ... Kynaston is interested in getting the feel of life close up, and his range of sources is formidable * <b><i>Spectator</i></b> * Masterful ... Kynaston has an enviable ability to see both the trees and the wood, and patterns start to appear ... Kynaston's project is already being acclaimed as one of the great achievements of modern history, and this fourth instalment, with its entrancing mix of entertainment, erudition and enlightenment, will enhance its status further * <b><i>Daily Telegraph</i></b> * This superb history captures the birth pangs of modern Britain ... It is a part of Kynaston's huge achievement that such moments of insight and pleasure should accompany what has become a monumental history of our recent past * <b><i>The Times</i></b> *</p><h2>Mandie and the Quilt Mystery (Mandie, Book 35)</h2><p>While digging through a chest, Mandie and her friends discover some wonderful old quilts, some of them made by her Cherokee grandmother some time ago.

Strongly influenced by surrealism, abstract expressionism, and minimalism, her work focuses on the exploration of her psyche. A recurring theme is her troubled childhood and difficult relationship with her father. Despite early success, she did not receive widespread acclaim until the &#x2019;70s. Her 1982 exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art was the museum&#x2019;s first-ever retrospective of a woman artist. Since then, she has exhibited worldwide, producing a beguiling body of work featuring spiders, cages, architectural sculptures, drawings, and found objects ranging in scale from intimate to monumental. Her staggering variety of mediums includes rubber, wood, stone, metal, and fabric. In 1993, she represented the United States at the Venice Biennale. This book accompanies a major retrospective touring exhibition. An overview of Bourgeois&#x2019;s career, it covers individual works, art movements, other artists, and themes that have played an important role in her life and art, with text by acclaimed authors and critics, including Julia Kristeva, Elisabeth Lebovici, Frances Morris, Mignon Nixon, Linda Nochlin, Robert Storr, Alex Potts, Marina Warner, and Deborah Wye. Exhibition Schedule:Tate Modern, London (October 11, 2007&#x2013;January 20, 2008) Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris (March 5&#x2013;June 2008) Guggenheim Museum, New York (June 27&#x2013;September 28, 2008) LAMoCA (October 25, 2008&#x2013;January 25, 2009) Hirshhorn, Washington (February 28&#x2013;June 7, 2009 tentative)</p><p>Louise Bourgeois, born in 1911, studied at the �cole du Louvre and the �cole des Beaux-Arts. She worked as Fernand L�ger&#x2019;s assistant and in 1938 relocated to New York, where she has lived since. Her work is represented in major museums, including The Guggenheim, The Museum of Modern Art, The National Gallery of Art, and others. Frances Morris is head of collections at Tate Modern. Marie-Laure Bernadac is chief curator of Contemporary Art at the Louvre.One contributor to this retrospective asks: How is it that an artist whose career spans some seventy years continues to appear vital and contemporary...? Bourgeois's work, sometimes abstract and sometimes not, is sculpture or installation, may be sewn out of fabric or carved out of wood, and is ever intimate, feminist, eccentric and interesting. The difficulty of memorializing the work of such an extraordinary living artist is handled through a glossary of terms, a neat trick that puts Etching next to Existentialism and Materials next to Maternity. This treatment pairs shorter and longer essays by art critics with excerpts from Bourgeois's diaries and interviews, providing a deep and textured sense of the artist's biography. Personally and creatively, Bourgeois was deeply affected by her mother's tolerance of her father's affair with the daughter's own tutor. Bourgeois's work doesn't follow any clear trajectory, so the episodic nature of this presentation displays her work appropriately. It can be difficult to connect a piece of text to the hundreds of reproductions of the artist's work (many in full spreads), but the overall impression is very effective&#x2014;a suitable presentation for this intriguing and multifaceted artist. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The twenty books in the O&#39;Brian canon, featuring the lives and adventures of Captain Jack Aubrey and his friend and confidant, the naval surgeon, Stephen Maturin, are read and lauded across the world for their blend of classic storytelling, historical scholarly accuracy and consistently inspired characterisation. In Jack Aubrey Commands Brian Lavery, one of the most respected naval historians of his generation, relates the naval fiction of Patrick O&#39;Brian and C S Forester to the real world inhabited by famous Royal Navy heroes such as Lord Nelson, Sir Sidney Smith and Thomas Cochrane. It draws on the experiences and activities of men such as Frederick Marryat, the founder of naval fiction, the Austen brothers whose sister Jane created our most intimate picture of shore life in the period, and Nelson&#39;s chaplain Alexander Scott, who also served as a part-time spy. All these individuals and others provided inspiration for Patrick O&#39;Brian&#39;s character of Jack Aubrey. The historical naval facts behind the great works of naval fiction are fully explored while the text fully contextualises a number of key episodes and characters as well as the minutiae of naval life in the era of Nelson, as it is put forward in these enduring sea stories. The book includes a foreword by Peter Weir, director of Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World, where he outlines the challenges posed by, and encountered in, the dramatisation of the O&#39;Brian novels.</p><p>Brian Lavery is Curator of Ship Technology at the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, and a renowned expert on the sailing navy.

But who sent it and why? Andreas' search for answers takes him deep into the sordid, criminal side of Athens nightlife and then to the glittering world of Athens society where age-old frictions between old and new money breed jealousy, murder, revenge, revolutionaries, and some very dangerous truths.

The alleys and streets were quiet. Trash cans stood untouched, lids strangely in place. Dogs sniffed the air anxiously while mice ran freely, unafraid of predators. Music drifted from apartment windows, unaccompanied by feline howls. The cat population had a meeting to attend. Large and small, old and young, cats headed to an old abandoned theater. When the room was filled, the eyes of the cats focused toward the front, wherea large gray cat with battle scars made his way to the stage. He spoke. "I, Ebenezer, call the meeting to order." "This better be good," called a calico from the back. "I had to plot for three days to get out of the house to come." A Siamese slunk back and forth along the sideline. "And I don't have claws, so I took a big risk getting here." A fat cat yelled, "It rained yesterday. You know how I hate to get my feet wet, but I did it just to get here, even though I heard we might be meeting with dogs." "Dogs?" a kitten asked, shaking. "That was just a rumor," Ebenezer said. "There was some discussion about a possible meeting with the WOOF Society, Words of Our Friends. You see, dogs have written diaries too." "Dogs? Diaries? Our dog can't even clean himself," a cat yelled. "How many dogs have enough sense to write a diary?" said an alley cat. "I agree. The dog in my house could no more write a diary than climb a tree." "Not so fast," Ebenezer said. "I've read some dog diaries. The stories are not bad." Yowls erupted. Ebenezer waited for the sounds to die down, then spoke. "On to our business." "Tell us more," called a young cat from the third row. "This is my first meeting." "As many of you know, for some time now we have been collecting writings by members of our feline community. We call this group MEOW (Memories Expressed in Our Writing)." Meows of agreement echoed throughout the room. A paw went up. "Yes, Cisco." Cisco cleared his throat. "Hairball," someone yelled from the back. Several cats laughed. Others coughed. "Order!" called Ebenezer. "Cisco, go ahead." "What kinds of writings will we hear tonight?" "There are many different tales." "Not from the Manx," someone yelled. "They don't have tails." Everyone laughed, except the Manxes, who hissed. Ebenezer continued. "Throughout history, cats in their own quiet way have been writing stories--stories of their lives and the lives of others. Tonight, we will hear diaries from a Gypsy cat, a pirate cat, and many more." "Let's get started," called an Abyssinian. "We will begin with the diary of a cat named Fuzzy, who learned that it's a delicate balance to keep the best of both worlds. Now, get comfortable." Some cats curled into balls, others tucked their front paws neatly underneath their bodies. Everyone settled into position and awaited the first reading. "Fuzzy, please come forward for the reading of the first of the cat diaries."

Reprint.</p><p>Setting: Contemporary U.S.<br> Sensuality Rating: 8<p> Bestselling author Nora Roberts continues her acclaimed MacGregor series with two romantic novellas in <i>The MacGregors: Alan and Grant</i>. In <i>All the Possibilities</i>, Washington, D.C., socialite Shelby Campbell meets Senator Alan MacGregor and the attraction is immediate and powerful. Unfortunately, Shelby is determined to avoid romantic involvement with any public figure, a resolve that stems from her witnessing her politician father's assassination. A man in the spotlight, especially a man in politics, is too vulnerable, and she can't risk losing someone she loves again. Her determination is no match for Alan's, though, as the handsome MacGregor lays siege to the Campbell heart with weapons too compelling to resist.</p><p> In <i>One Man's Art</i>, Shelby's brother, Grant Campbell, has found his own way of coping with his loss. A famous cartoonist and political satirist, Grant lives as a virtual hermit in an isolated Maine lighthouse, jealously guarding his privacy. His battlements are breached, however, when beautiful Genvieve Grandeau arrives sodden and stranded on his doorstep. Genvieve, herself a renowned artist, has come to Maine seeking solitude and inspiration. When Grant's grudging willingness to assist a damsel in distress turns to outright surliness as he camouflages his attraction to her, she sets upon a mission to make him regret his rudeness. Soon she has more on her hands than she expected, as she and Grant both recognize a passion that neither can deny.</p><p> Though thinner in plot than the typical Roberts book--due to the shorter, double-novella format--<i>The MacGregors: Alan and Grant</i> nonetheless contains the same compelling characters, rich description, and sensuous storytelling known and loved by Roberts fans. This newest MacGregor novel should please both her devoted readers and new readers alike. <i>--Lisa Wanttaja</i></p><p><strong>Angela Dawe</strong>&nbsp;is originally from Lansing, Michigan, and currently calls Chicago home.

But what about the many other ways the government drains money from our wallets? Have you studied your cell phone bill? Customers in New York State pay an average of 24.36% in federal, state and local taxes on their wireless bills. They&#x2019;re also charged for obscure services they didn&#x2019;t ask for and don&#x2019;t understand like a universal service fund fee, an FCC compliance fee, a line service fee, and an emergency services fee. These aren&#x2019;t taxes, strictly speaking. The government imposes these administrative and regulatory costs, and your wireless provider passes them along to you. But the effect is exactly the same.</p><p> What about your cable bill? Your power bill? Your water bill? The cost of a gallon of gas, a cab ride, a hotel stay and a movie ticket are all inflated by hidden fees. How much of what you pay at the pump, the box office, or the airport is really an indirect tax?</p><p> In a series of short, pointed, fact-laden, humorous chapters, Tate exposes the vast government shakedown that consumes up to half of your income&#x2015;and also explains where these hidden fees and taxes come from.</p></p><p>KRISTIN TATE is an author and political columnist based in New York City.

This is a life-or-death mission for ONI's black-ops team, Kilo-Five, which is tasked with preventing the ruthless Elites, once the military leaders of the Covenant, from regrouping and threatening humankind again. What began as a routine dirty-tricks operation -- keeping the Elites busy with their own insurrection -- turns into a desperate bid to extract one member of Kilo-Five from the seething heart of an alien civil war. </p><p>But troubles never come singly for Kilo-Five. Colonial terrorism is once again surfacing on one of the worlds that survived the war against the Covenant, and the man behind it is much more than just a name to Spartan-010. Meanwhile, the treasure trove of Forerunner technology recovered from the shield world of Onyx is being put to work while a kidnapped Elite plots vengeance on the humans he fears will bring his people to the brink of destruction.</p></p><p>No. 1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling novelist, screenwriter, and comics author Karen Traviss has received critical acclaim for her award-nominated Wess'har series, as well as regularly hitting the bestseller lists with her Star Wars<i>,</i> Gears of War<i>, </i>and<i> </i>Halo<i> </i>work.

At the suggestion of famed French composer Arthur Honegger, he turned to film music, and thus began a "double life." Well-known for his movie scores, including Spellbound , The Lost Weekend , The Thief of Baghdad and Ben-Hur , Rozsa has also written numerous classical works that have been performed by major orchestras the world over. In this serviceable, straightforward autobiography he chronicles his rise to success, from his childhood in a small Hungarian town to the film studios of Hollywood. He tells an uncomplicated tale of a life of accomplishment, filled with reminiscences of his friendships with the rich and famous. Now in his 80s, Rozsa looks back with justifiable satisfaction on a career in which he has composed in two styles without compromising either.

The pursuit of justice has become his passion &#x2014; a passion that began during the trial of the man who murdered Dunne's daughter and who was sentenced to six and a half years and released in less than three. Dunne's account of that trial and its shocking result became the first of his many classic essays on justice. <br><br>Dominick Dunne's essays do much more than simply describe; his investigations have shed new light on those crimes and their perpetrators &#x2014; and demonstrated how it is possible for some to skirt, even flout, the law. His persistence and personal involvement in the matter of Martha Moxley's murder was an important catalyst in bringing a dormant case back to life. <br><br>Here in one volume are Dominick Dunne's mesmerizing tales of justice denied and justice affirmed. Whether writing of Vicki Morgan's hideous death; Claus von B�low's romp through two trials; the media frenzy of Los Angeles in the age of O.J. Simpson; the death by fire of multibillionaire banker Edmund Safra in Monaco; or the ominous silence surrounding the death of Martha Moxley in Greenwich, Connecticut, and the indictment &#x2014; decades later &#x2014; of Michael Skakel, Dominick Dunne tells it honestly and tells it from his unique perspective. His search for the truth is relentless. His courage and his storytelling skills shine from every page.</p><p><i>"In my everyday life over the last fifty years, it has been my curious lot to move among the rich and famous and powerful, always as an outsider, always listening, watching, remembering."</i><p> Writing about the crimes of the rich and famous for <i>Vanity Fair</i> with this insider's status, Dominick Dunne has borne witness to the often bizarre personalities who surround high-profile cases and their telling intimacies. Andrea Reynolds, for instance, dressed only in a negligee and jewelry, insists that her jewels are finer than those of the comatose woman in whose apartment she resides and whom her lover, Claus von Bulow, is charged with attempting to murder. The essays in <i>Justice</i> offer a fascinating, disturbing, and wry look at the cast of a half dozen high-profile trials, including Lyle and Erik Menendez, who murdered their affluent parents; Marvin Pancoast, who beat the $18,000-a-month mistress of Alfred Bloomingdale to death with a baseball bat; the multibillionaire banker Edmund Safra, who suffocated in his own bunker-like bathroom in Monaco; and the gossiping members of Los Angeles society during "All O.J., All the Time." </p><p> The most moving story by far is the title piece, about the murder of Dunne's daughter, the actress Dominique Dunne, by her ex-boyfriend, who walked away with a pitifully light sentence thanks to the extremes taken by his defense lawyer and the vanity of the judge. While the succeeding stories don't have the same poignancy, Dunne still makes them personal--after all, he knows many of those involved, and justice truly is personal for him. In fact, it is this moral authority that enables him to enter the strange universe of high-society crime and write about it with no pretense of objectivity, but rather with rage toward the short shrift justice is so often given in celebrity cases. The counterpoint to his anger is a delicious irony in the form of fascinating subplots, jet-set gossip, and terrific quotes straight from some of the horses' mouths. Dunne has both a sharp sense of the absurd and a trenchant eye for injustice in any form. <i>--Lesley Reed</i></p>&#x201c;Dunne mixes shrewd insight into the legal process with dishy use of his considerable social skills.

Yet the outfit, dubbed the Kangaroo Squadron, proved remarkably resilient and successful, conducting long-range bombing raids, carrying out armed reconnaissance missions, and rescuing General MacArthur and his staff from the Philippines.<br><br>Before now, the story of their courage and determination in the face of overwhelming odds has largely been untold. Using eyewitness accounts from diaries, letters, interviews, and memoirs, as well as Japanese sources, historian Bruce Gamble brings to vivid life this dramatic true account.<br><br>But the Kangaroo Squadron's story doesn't end in World War II. One of the squadron's B-17 bombers, which crash-landed on its first mission, was recovered from New Guinea after almost seventy years in a jungle swamp. The intertwined stories of the Kangaroo Squadron and the "Swamp Ghost" are filled with thrilling accounts of aerial combat, an epic survival story, and the powerful mystique of an invaluable war relic.<br></p><p><b>Bruce Gamble</b> is an award-winning author and historian who served as a Naval Flight Officer during the closing years of the Cold War. Medically retired in 1989, he began working for the Naval Aviation Museum Foundation before turning to freelance writing.

He lives near Madison, Georgia."In the darkest days of World War II in the Pacific, a squadron of forgotten heroes gave their all, becoming the first to strike back against the Japanese. <i>Kangaroo Squadron</i> is an inspiring, beautifully crafted tale of ordinary Americans exhibiting extraordinary heroism and grit when it mattered most."--<b>Alex Kershaw</b>, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Longest Winter</i> and <i>The First Wave</i><br>"Bruce Gamble has beautifully captured the dark early days of World War II--and the brave American airmen willing to take the fight to the enemy. With a novelists's gift for storytelling, Gamble takes readers into cockpits over Japanese bases, drops them waist-deep in malarial swamps, and lets them unwind in dusty outback bars. <i>Kangaroo Squadron</i> is a soaring story and a triumph of the American spirit."--<b>James M.

In <i>Kangaroo Squadron</i> he has crafted a fascinating account of men and machines, painting a compelling picture of what it was like to fight as an American aviator during the very darkest days of the Pacific War. Outstanding!"--<b>Jonathan Parshall</b>, co-author of <i>Shattered Sword: The Untold Story of the Battle of Midway</i><br>"Bruce Gamble's excellent history of the U.S. Army's B-17 bombers in the Pacific, officially the Southern Bomber Command but colloquially known as the Kangaroo Squadron, is a triumph. The characters are vivid and the narrative gripping; the story of the downed B-17 later known as the 'Swamp Ghost' is especially riveting. Throughout, Gamble's mastery of aircraft characteristics is impeccable, and his fast-paced storytelling is irresistible."--<b>Craig L. Symonds</b>, author of <i>World War II at Sea: A Global History</i><br>"Flying Boeing B-17s, the Kangaroo Squadron's aircrews and maintenance men fought not only Imperial Japan but weather, geography, and a perennial shortage of everything--except courage and dedication. Their example remains an inspiration to Americans three generations later, thanks to Bruce Gamble's in-depth research and deft writing."--<b>Barrett Tillman</b>, author of <i>On Wave and Wing: The 100-Year Quest to Perfect the Aircraft Carrier</i><br>"Gamble has a solid grasp of big-picture strategy and of the alternating tedium and terror of war, especially as bomber crews experienced it, never knowing when anti-aircraft fire would take them down or the fuel would run out before they could return to base."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></i></b><br><br>"Gamble delivers an inspiring and impeccably researched tale...Both the air war expert and the general reader will enjoy and learn something from this well-crafted work."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Publishers Weekly</i></i></b><br><br>"Gamble is a fine story-teller.

In fact, these signs were designed by the Lord to alert true believers to his imminent return. The question is, Will you recognize the signs? In this revised edition, David Ridges, author of the best-selling Gospel Studies Made Easier series, combines current events with ancient prophecy to illuminate how the signs of the times are already being fulfilled in our day. By carefully compiling his latest research and the words of modern prophets, Ridges presents these signs in a clear, easy-to-follow format, perfect for at-a-glance reference or more in-depth study. To help you understand them quickly, these signs are categorized as: 1. Fulfilled 2. Being Fulfilled 3. Yet to be Fulfilled Don t panic.

It's not a book that produces fear, but rather peace and knowledge. I highly recommend it if you're looking for a good review of the signs of the times within the gospel context. --Amazon<br><br>I know a good book when I see it. And, this is an incredible book! You will not regret putting this one on your shelf. And, you may find yourself referring to it time and time again as the signs of the times are fulfilled. I bought the last book, and I thought it was a 4 star effort. But, this one added a ton of good content before and after the 65 signs of the times section. It jumped to a ten star book in my opinion. I just wish I could give it the rest of the stars that it deserves. And, I have no conflict of interest when I say this. Get this book and read it! I got it in the mail today and read substantial sections of it with my wife for the next 4 or 5 hours. I just couldn't put it down. Nice job to the author on this one! --Amazon<br><br>I am extremely impressed with 65 Signs of the Times. I started reading it and couldn't put it down. I re-read and highlighted all facts important to me and my questions. I KNOW WHAT HE WRITES IS TRUE WORDS. My sister recommended it to me and now my daughter wants to own one. David tells it like it is and I am comfortable with trusting what he rights because of my own personal reasons. It has most definitely motivated me and my family to be more prepared and we are pro-activley becoming more organized. It has been encouraging to confirm and testify what I (we) already believe. I have intentions to purchase more of his books in the future. VERY insightful and VERY educational.

A handmaid, Mary, arrives to help Nora just as rumors begin to spread that Micheal is a changeling child who is bringing bad luck to the valley. Determined to banish evil, Nora and Mary enlist the help of Nance, an elderly wanderer who understands the magic of the old ways. <br>Set in a lost world bound by its own laws, THE GOOD PEOPLE is Hannah Kent's startling new novel about absolute belief and devoted love. Terrifying, thrilling and moving in equal measure, this follow-up to <em>Burial Rites</em> shows an author at the height of her powers.</p><p>Hannah Kent was born in Adelaide in 1985. Her first novel, <i>Burial Rites</i>, has been translated into nearly thirty languages and was shortlisted for the Baileys Women's Prize for Fiction (formerly the Orange Prize), the <i>Guardian</i> First Book Award and the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award. Hannah is also the co-founder and publishing director of Australian literary journal <i>Kill Your Darlings</i>. THE GOOD PEOPLE<em> </em>is her second novel.<b></b>"Ms. Kent has a knack for conjuring the unsettled spirit world through deft stylistic flourishes...<b>THE GOOD PEOPLE</b> is far from a high-handed condemnation of superstitious belief. It makes the terrors of the past feel palpable and imminent. It makes you reach for whatever good luck charms you carry with you."&#x2015;<b><i>Sam Sacks, <b><i>The Wall Street Journal</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Rural pre-famine Ireland in all its beauty and desolation is alive on every page of this exquisite novel...'The Good People' is a dramatic tale of desperation, set in a bleak time and place when no amount of protective ritual and belief - or goodness - can rescue people from their circumstances."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Katherine Weber, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Kent's suspenseful storytelling plunges readers into early 19th-century Ireland. She brings vivid life to the hardscrabble scenes...Although 'The Good People' is fiction, it faithfully represents the hold of ancient Celtic myths on generations of Irish."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Minneapolis Star Tribune</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Add Kent to the list of terrific Australian novelists writing today. While Liane Moriarty (<i>Big Little Lies</i>) mines modern marriage and mores for her page-turning mysteries, Kent (<i>Burial Rites</i>) goes back in time to find reality-based stories of women who pay the price for challenging society's expectations. <i>The Good People</i> has great characters, a setting that seeps into your bones and the always compelling tug between the spiritual and the superstitious."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>USA Today (starred review)</i></b></i></b><br><br>"If Stevie Wonder is correct, when you believe in things you don't understand, then you suffer.

Kent's immersive setting, benefiting from impressive historical research and the use of Gaelic vocabulary, features both a dramatically alive natural world and a believably fearsome supernatural one. Inspired by true events and exploring those places where reason, religion, and superstition cross paths, this will please lovers of haunting literary fiction. "&#x2015;<b><i><strong><em>Booklist</em> </strong></i></b><br><br>"Kent has a terrific feel for the language of her setting..This is a serious and compelling novel about those in desperate circumstances cling to ritual as a bulwark against their own powerlessness."&#x2015;<b><i><i><strong>The Guardian</strong></i></i></b><br><br>"Taking its inspiration from newspaper reports of a real court case in County Kerry in 1826, THE GOOD PEOPLE is an even better novel than <em>Burial Rites-</em>a starkly realized tale of love, grief and misconceived beliefs."&#x2015;<b><i><em><strong>The Sunday Times UK</strong></em></i></b></p><h2>Biography of Lenin</h2><p><p>Lenin is a colossal figure whose influence on twentieth-century history cannot be underestimated. Robert Service has written a calmly authoritative biography on this seemingly unknowable figure. Making use of recently opened archives, he has been able to piece together the private as well as the public life, giving the first complete picture of Lenin.</p><p>This biography simultaneously provides an account of one of the greatest turning points in modern history. Through the prism of Lenin`s career, Service examines events such as the October Revolution and the ideas of Marxism-Leninism, the one-party state, economic modernisation, dictatorship, and the politics of inter-war Europe. In discovering the origins of the USSR, he casts light on the nature of the state and society which Lenin left behind and which have not entirely disappeared after the collapse of the Soviet regime in 1991.</p><p>`Immensely scholarly but also vivid and readable. This is a splendid book, much the best that I have ever read about Lenin...I was overwhelmed by the power and vividness of this portrait.` Dominic Lieven, <em>Sunday Telegraph </em></p><p>`He has managed skilfully to depict the surreal life of an obsessive, brilliant and stubborn individual` <em>Guardian </em></p><p>`Lenin`s life was politics, but Service has succeeded in keeping Lenin the man in focus throughout... This book deserves a place among the best studies of one of the most fascinating figures in modern history` Harold Shukman, <em>The Times</em></p></p><p>LENIN: His politics still reverberate around the world even after the end of the USSR. His name elicits revulsion and reverence. And yet Lenin the man remains largely a mystery. This biography shows us Lenin as we have never seen him, in his full complexity as revolutionary, political leader, thinker, and private person.<p>Born Vladimir Illich Ulyanov in 1870, the son of a schools inspector and a doctor's daughter, Lenin was to become the greatest single force in the Soviet revolution -- and perhaps the most influential politician of the twentieth century. Drawing on sources only recently discovered, Robert Service explores the social, cultural, and political catalysts for Lenin's explosion into global prominence. His book gives us the vast panorama of Russia in that awesome vortex of change from tsarism's collapse to the establishment of the communist one-party state. Through the prism of Lenin's career Service focuses on dictatorship, the Marxist revolutionary dream, civil war, and inter-war European politics. And we are shown how Lenin, despite the hardships he inflicted, was widely mourned after his death in 1924.</p><p>Robert Service's Lenin is a political colossus but also a believable human being. This biography stresses the importance of his supportive family and of its ethnic and cultural background. Service examines his education, upbringing, and the troubles of his early life to explain the emergence of a rebel whose devotion to destruction proved greater than his love for the 'proletariat' he supposedly served. We are enabled to see how his intellectual preoccupations and inner rage underwent volatile interaction and propelled his career from young Marxist activist to founder ofthe communist party and the Soviet state -- and how he bequeathed to Russia a legacy of political oppression and social intimidation that has yet to be expunged.</p>Robert Service is a Fellow of the British Academy and of St Antony&#x2019;s College, Oxford. He has written several books, including the highly acclaimed Lenin: A Biography, Russia: Experiment with a People , Stalin: A Biography and Comrades: A History of World Communism, as well as many other books on Russia&#x2019;s past and present. Married with four children, he lives in London.</p><h2>Spark Bible NRSV</h2><p>Designed for kids in grades 3 - 6, the Spark Bible NRSV - Gift Edition is the perfect gift for your third graders.

Now, in a beautifully illustrated historical atlas, noted scholar of religion Malise Ruthven recounts the fascinating and important history of the Islamic world. </p><p> </p><p> From the birth of the prophet Muhammed to the independence of post-Soviet Muslim states in Central Asia, this accessible and informative atlas explains the historical evolution of Islamic societies. Short essays cover a wide variety of themes, including the central roles played by <i>sharia</i> (divine law) and <i>fiqh</i> (jurisprudence); philosophy; arts and architecture; the Muslim city; trade, commerce, and manufacturing; marriage and family life; tribal distributions; kinship and dynastic power; ritual and devotional practices; Sufism; modernist and reformist trends; the European domination of the Islamic world; the rise of the modern national state; oil exports and arms imports; and Muslim populations in non-Muslim countries, including the United States. </p><p> </p><p> Lucid and inviting full-color maps chronicle the changing internal and external boundaries of the Islamic world, showing the principal trade routes through which goods, ideas, and customs spread. Ruthven traces the impact of various Islamic dynasties in art and architecture and shows the distribution of sects and religious minorities, the structure of Islamic cities, and the distribution of resources. Among the book's valuable contributions is the incorporation of the often neglected geographical and environmental factors, from the Fertile Crescent to the North African desert, that have helped shape Islamic history. </p><p> </p><p> Rich in narrative and visual detail that illuminates the story of Islamic civilization, this timely atlas is an indispensable resource to anyone interested in world history and religion. </p></p><p>Malise Ruthven is a former editor with the BBC Arabic Service and World Service in London and is the author of Islam in the World and Islam: A Very Short Introduction.<br><br>Azim Nanji is Professor and Director of the Institute of Ismaili Studies and visiting professor at Stanford University.Islam dominates the news these days--be it a story on Shia uprisings in Iraq, banning headscarves in French schools or prosecuting extremists involved in the Sept. 11 attacks--yet few Americans are familiar with the religion's complex history.

Wexford is intrigued by the unusual circumstances of the murder, but he&#x2019;s also desperate to escape the chatty Maxine.<br> <br> A single mother to a teenage girl, Hussain was a woman working in a male-dominated profession. Of mixed race and an outspoken church reformer, she had turned some in her congregation against her, including the conservative vicar&#x2019;s warden. Could one of her enemies in the church have gone so far as to kill her? Or could it have been the elderly next-door gardener with a muddled alibi?<br> <br> As Wexford searches the vicar&#x2019;s house alongside the police, he sees a book, Newman&#x2019;s <i>Apologia Pro Vita Sua</i>, lying on Hussain&#x2019;s bedside table. Inside it is a letter serving as a bookmark. Without thinking much, Wexford puts it into his pocket. Wexford soon realizes he has made a grave error&#x2014;he&#x2019;s removed a piece of evidence from the crime scene. Yet what he finds inside begins to illuminate the murky past of Sarah Hussain. Is there more to her than meets the eye?<br> <br> <i>No Man&#x2019;s Nightingale</i> is Ruth Rendell&#x2019;s masterful twenty-fourth installment in one of the great crime series of all time.</p><p>Ruth Rendell (1930&#x2013;2015) won three Edgar Awards, the highest accolade from Mystery Writers of America, as well as four Gold Daggers and a Diamond Dagger for outstanding contribution to the genre from England&#x2019;s prestigious Crime Writ�ers&#x2019; Association. Her remarkable career spanned a half century, with more than sixty books published. A member of the House of Lords, she was one of the great literary figures of our time.No Man&#x2019;s Nightingale 1<p></p> <br>MAXINE WAS PROUD of having three jobs. These days more and more people had none. She had no sympathy for them but congratulated herself on her own initiative. Two mornings a week she cleaned for Mrs. Wexford, two mornings for Mrs. Crocker, afternoons for two other Kingsmarkham women, did gardening and cleaned cars for Mr. Wexford and Dr. Crocker and babysat every evening where she was wanted for those young enough to need a baby-sitter. Cleaning she did for the women and gardening and car-washing for the men because she had never believed in any of that feminism or equality stuff. It was a well-known fact that men didn&#x2019;t notice whether a house was clean or not, and normal women weren&#x2019;t interested in cars or lawns. Maxine charged maximum rates for baby-sitting except for her son and his partner, who got her services for free. As for the others, those who had kids must expect to pay for them. She&#x2019;d had four and she knew.<br> <br>She was a good worker, reliable, punctual, and reasonably honest, and the only condition she made was payment in cash. Wexford, who after all had until recently been a policeman, demurred at that but eventually gave in the way the tax inspector up the road did. After all, at least a dozen other households would have paid almost anything to secure Maxine&#x2019;s services. She had one drawback. She talked. She talked not just while she was having a break for a cup of tea or while she was getting out or putting away the tools, but all the time she was working and to whoever happened to be in the room or upstairs in the kitchen. The work got done and efficiently while the words poured out on a steady monotone.<br> <br>That day she began on a story of how her son Jason, now manager of the Kingsmarkham Questo supermarket, had dealt with a man complaining about one of Jason&#x2019;s checkout girls. The woman had apparently called him &#x201c;elderly.&#x201d; But Jason had handled it brilliantly, pacifying the man and sending him home in a supervisor&#x2019;s car. &#x201c;Now my Jason used to be a right tearaway,&#x201d; Maxine went on, and not for the first time. &#x201c;Not in one of them gangs, I&#x2019;m not saying that, and he never got no ASBOs, but a bit of shoplifting, it was like it came natural to him, and out all night and underage drinking&#x2014;well, binge-drinking like they call it. As for the smack and what do they call them, description drugs&#x2014;mind Mr. Wexford can&#x2019;t hear me, hope he&#x2019;s out of hearshot&#x2014;all that he went in for, and now, since him and Nicky had a kid, he&#x2019;s a changed character. The perfect dad, I still can&#x2019;t believe it.&#x201d; She applied impregnated wadding to the silver with renewed vigour, then a duster, then the wadding once more. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s over a year old now, his Isabella is, but when she was a neo-nettle, it was never Nicky got up to her in the night, she never had to. No, it was my Jason had her out of her cot before the first peep was out of her. Walked her up and down, cooing at her like I&#x2019;ve never heard a bloke go on so. Mind you, that Nicky never showed no gratitude. I call it unnatural a mum with a new baby sleeping the night through, and I&#x2019;ve told her so.&#x201d;<br> <br>Even Maxine sometimes had to pause to draw breath. Dora Wexford seized her opportunity, said she had to go out and Maxine&#x2019;s money was in an envelope on the hall table. The resumed monologue pursued her as she ran out to the conservatory to tell her husband she&#x2019;d be back in an hour or so.<br> <br>Wexford was sitting in a cane armchair in autumn sunshine doing what many a man or woman plans to do on retirement but few put into practice, reading The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. He had embarked on it expecting to find it heavy going, but instead becoming fast enraptured and enjoying every word. Reaching the end of the first volume, he was happy to anticipate five more and told Dora she&#x2019;d picked her moment to desert him.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s your turn,&#x201d; she whispered.<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know we had a schedule.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know now. Here starts your tour of duty.&#x201d;<br> <br>As Dora left, Maxine swooped, pushing the vacuum cleaner and continuing to hold on to it while she peered over his shoulder.<br> <br>&#x201c;Got a guide to Rome there, I see. Going there on your holidays, are you? Me and my sister took in Rome on our Ten Italian Cities tour. Oh, it was lovely but hot, you wouldn&#x2019;t believe. I said to my Jason, you and Nicky want to go there on your honeymoon when you get around to tying the knot there&#x2019;s no untying, only these days there is of course, no point in getting married if you ask me. I never did and I&#x2019;m not ashamed of it.&#x201d; She started up the vacuum cleaner but continued to talk. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Nicky as wants it, one of them big white weddings like they all want these days, costs thousands, but she&#x2019;s a big spender, good job my Jason&#x2019;s in work like so many&#x2019;s not.&#x201d; The voice became a buzz under the vacuum&#x2019;s roar. She raised it. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t reckon my Jason&#x2019;d go away on a honeymoon or anything else come to that without Isabella. He can&#x2019;t bear that kid out of his sight for his eight hours&#x2019; work let alone a week. Talk about worshipping the ground she treads on, only she don&#x2019;t tread yet, crawls more like.&#x201d; A pause to change the tool on the end of the vacuum-cleaner hose. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll know about that poor lady vicar getting herself killed and me finding the body. It was all over the papers and on the telly. I reckon you take an interest though you&#x2019;re not doing the work no more. I had a cleaning job there with her up till a couple of weeks back, but there was things we never saw eye to eye on, not to mention her not wanting to pay cash, wanted to do it on line if you please and I couldn&#x2019;t be doing with that. She always left the back door open and I popped in to collect the money she owed me and it gave me a terrible turn. No blood, of course, not with strangling, but still a shock. Don&#x2019;t bear thinking of, does it? Still, I reckon you had to think of things like that, it being your job. You must be relieved getting all that over with . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Standing up, clutching his book, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to have a bath!&#x201d; Wexford shouted above the vacuum&#x2019;s roar.<br> <br>Maxine was startled from her monologue. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s ten thirty.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A very good time to have a bath,&#x201d; said Wexford, making for the stairs, reading as he went the last lines of volume one, describing another murder, that of Julius Caesar: . . . during the greatest part of a year, the orb of the sun appeared pale and without splendour. This season of obscurity, which cannot surely be compared with the preternatural obscurity of the Passion, had already been celebrated by most of the poets and historians of that memorable age. . . .<br> <br>His mobile was ringing. Detective Superintendent Burden, known to the phone-contacts list as Mike.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m off to have a look at St. Peter&#x2019;s Vicarage, taking Lynn with me and I thought you might like to come too.&#x201d;<br> <br>Wexford had already had a shower that day. A bath at 10:30 a.m. wasn&#x2019;t needful, only seized upon as a refuge from Maxine. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d love to.&#x201d; He tried to keep the enthusiasm out of his voice, tried and failed.<br> <br>Sounding surprised, Burden said, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t get excited. It&#x2019;s no big deal.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It is for me.&#x201d;<br> <br>He closed the bathroom door. Probably, Maxine wouldn&#x2019;t open it but would perhaps conclude that he was having an exceptionally long bath. The vacuum cleaner still roaring, he escaped out the front door, closing it after him by an almost silent turning of the key in the lock. Taking an interested member of the public&#x2014;that, after all, was what he was&#x2014;on a call or calls that were part of a criminal investigation was something Wexford had seldom done while he was himself an investigating officer. And his accompanying Superintendent Ede of the Met on the vault enquiries was a different matter as he, though unpaid, had had a kind of job as Ede&#x2019;s aide. This visit, this opportune escape from Maxine, was undergone, he knew, because, once senior and junior officers, over the years they had become friends. Burden knew, none better, how much Wexford would wish to be involved in solving the mystery of who had killed the Reverend Sarah Hussain.<br> <br><br> <br>ALL WEXFORD KNEW of the death, apart from what Maxine had mentioned that morning, was what he had read in yesterday&#x2019;s Guardian and seen on the day-before-yesterday&#x2019;s regional television news. And seen of course when passing the vicarage. He could have seen more online, but he had cringed from its colourful headlines. Sarah Hussain was far from being the only woman ordained priest of the Church of England, but perhaps she was the only one to have been born in the United Kingdom of a white Irishwoman and an Indian immigrant. All this had been in the newspaper along with some limited biographical details, including information about her conversion to Christianity. There had been a photograph too of a gaunt woman with an aquiline nose in an academic cap and gown, olive-skinned but with large, deep-set, black eyes and what hair that showed a glossy jet-black. She had been forty-eight when she died and a single mother.<br> <br>Her origins, her looks&#x2014;striking but not handsome&#x2014;her age, her single parenthood, and, above all, that conversion made him think that her life could not have been easy. He would have liked to know more, and no doubt, he soon would. At the moment he wasn&#x2019;t even sure of where the murder had taken place, only that it was inside the vicarage. It wasn&#x2019;t a house he had ever been in, though Dora had. He was due to meet Mike and DC Lynn Fancourt in St. Peter&#x2019;s Church porch, the one at the side where the vestry was.<br> <br>The vicarage was some distance away and he had no need to pass the church to reach it. Heading for the gate that led out of Queen Street, he passed a young man pushing a baby buggy, a not particularly unusual sight these days, but he recognized this one as Maxine&#x2019;s son Jason. As industrious as his mother if not as vociferous, he must be having a day off from his job as a supermarket manager. Curious to see the child whose father worshipped the ground she crawled on, Wexford looked under the buggy hood and saw a pretty, pink-cheeked blonde, her long-lashed eyes closed in sleep. Wexford hastily withdrew his head from Jason&#x2019;s glare. No doubt the man was wary of any male person eyeing his little girl. Quite right too, he thought, himself the parent of girls who were now middle-aged women.<br> <br>He was a little early and by design. In his position it was better for him to be waiting for them than they for him. But Burden was seldom late, and the two of them appeared almost immediately from the high street. All the years he had known him, Wexford had never ceased to marvel at Burden&#x2019;s sartorial elegance. Where did he learn to dress like that? As far as he knew, Mike went shopping no more than any other man of Wexford&#x2019;s acquaintance. And it couldn&#x2019;t be the influence of his wives, neither of whom, Jean, long dead, or Jenny, the present one, had had much interest in clothes, preferring in their own cases no more than attention to &#x201c;neatness and fashion,&#x201d; as Jane Austen has it. But here was Burden today, his abundant but short hair now iron grey, his beige jacket (surely cashmere) over white shirt with beige-and-blue-figured tie, his beautifully creased trousers of denim, though discernibly&#x2014;how? How could one tell?&#x2014;not jeans.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good to see you,&#x201d; Burden said, though he had seen him and eaten lunch with him three days before.<br> <br>Lynn, whom he hadn&#x2019;t seen for as much as a year, said in a respectful tone, &#x201c;Good morning, sir.&#x201d;<br> <br>They walked along the path among gravestones and rosebushes towards Vicarage Lane. It was October and the leaves had only just begun to fall. Green, spiky conkers lay on the grass under the chestnut trees.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how much you know about this poor woman&#x2019;s murder, Reg,&#x201d; Burden said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Only what I read in the paper and saw on TV.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t go to church, do you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I hesitate to say my wife does, though it&#x2019;s true, and you know it already. She knew Sarah Hussain but through church, not socially. Where was she killed?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;In the vicarage. In her living room. You tell him, Lynn. You were one of the two officers who were the first to see the body.&#x201d;</p><h2>Eat The Rich</h2><p>America&#39;s most famous satirist is back with his latest New York Times best-seller and 1998 Notable Book of the Year, Eat the Rich is a hilarious and provocative look at economics.</p><p>A conservative, prosperous, American journalist gadding around the world laughing at all the ways less successful nations screw up their economy--this might not sound like the recipe for a great read, unless you're Rush Limbaugh, but if that journalist is P.J. O'Rourke you can be sure that you'll enjoy the ride even if you don't agree with the politics. Although <i>Eat the Rich</i> is subtitled <i>A Treatise on Economics</i>, O'Rourke spends relatively few pages tackling the complexities of monetary theory. He's much happier when flying from Sweden to Hong Kong to Tanzania to Moscow, gleefully recording every economic goof he can find. When he visits post-Communist Russia and finds a country that is as messed up by capitalism as it was by Communism, O'Rourke mixes jokes about black-market shoes with disturbing insights into a nation on the verge of collapse. P.J. O'Rourke is more than a humorist, he's an experienced international journalist with a lot of frequent-flyer miles, and this gives even his funniest riffs on the world's problems the ring of truth.In P. J. O'Rourke's classic best-seller Parliament of Whores, he attempted to explain the entire United States government. Now, in his most ambitious book since, he takes on an even broader subject, but one that is dear to us all-wealth. What is it? How do you get it? Or, as P.J. says, "Why do some places prosper and thrive, while others just suck?" <p>The obvious starting point is Wall Street. P.J. takes the reader on a scary, hilarious, and enlightening visit to the New York Stock Exchange, explaining along the way stocks, bonds, debentures, commodities, derivatives-and why the floor of the exchange is America's last refuge for nonpsychotic litterers. </p><p>P.J. then sets off on a world tour to investigate funny economics. Having seen "good capitalism" on Wall Street, he looks at "bad capitalism" in Albania, views "good socialism" in Sweden, and endures "bad socialism" in Cuba. Head reeling, he decides to tackle that Econ 101 course he avoided in college. The result is the world's only astute, comprehensive, and concise presentation of the basic principles of economics that can make you laugh, on purpose. </p><p>Armed with theory, P.J. ventures to Russia in a chapter entitled "How (or How Not) to Reform (Maybe) an Economy (If There Is One)," and discovers that Russia is a wonderful case study-unless, of course, you're Russian. P.J. then goes to Tanzania, a country rich in resources that is utterly destitute, before arriving in Hong Kong, which even as the British prepare to hand it over to the communists is a shining example of how unfettered economic activity can "make everything from nothing." P.J. ends up in Shanghai, observing a top-down transition to capitalism, a process he describes "as if the ancient Egyptians had constructed the pyramid of Khufu by saying, 'Thutnefer, you hold up this two-ton pointy piece while the rest of the slaves go get 2,300,000 blocks of stone.'" </p><p>P.J.'s conclusion in a nutshell: the free market is ugly and stupid, like going to the mall; the unfree market is just as ugly and just as stupid, except there's nothing in the mall and if you don't go there they shoot you. </p><p>Excerpts from Eat the Rich<br> "You buy stock because you think other people will think this stock is worth more later than you think it's worth now. Economists call this - in a rare example of comprehensible economist terminology - the 'Greater Fool Theory.' Speaking of folly, you can also invest in the commodities market. This is where you buy thousands of pork bellies and still don't know what you're going to have for dinner because, in the first place, you're broke from fooling around in the commodities market and, in the second place, you're not completely insane. You didn't actually have those pork bellies delivered to your house. What you did was buy a 'futures contract' from a person who promises to provide you with pork bellies in a couple of months if you pay him for pork bellies today. You did this because you think pork belly prices will rise and you'll be able to resell the delivery contract and make out like a . . . perhaps 'make out like a pig' is not the appropriate simile in this case. Of course, if prices fall, you've still got the pork bellies, and won't your spouse be surprised?" </p><p>"The New Russians are an amazing bunch. The men wear three-piece suits with stripes the width and color used to indicate no passing on two-lane highways. The neckties are as wide as the wives. These wives have, I think, covered their bodies in Elmer's Glue and run through the boutiques of Palm Springs, buying whatever stuck." </p><p>"Omnipresent amid all the frenzy of Shanghai is that famous portrait, that modern icon. The faintly smiling, bland yet somehow threatening visage appears in brilliant red hues on placards and posters and is painted huge on the sides of buildings. Some call him a genius. Others blame him for the deaths of millions. There are those who say his military reputation was inflated, yet he conquered the mainland in short order. Yes, it's Colonel Sanders." </p><p>"The example of efficiency that economists usually give is guns and butter. A society can produce both guns and butter, they say, but if the society wants to produce more guns it will have to - because of allocation of resources, capital and labor - produce less butter. Using this example you'll notice that, at the far reaches of gun-producing efficiency, howitzers are being manufactured by cows. And this is just one of the reasons we can't take economists too seriously." </p><p>Praise for Eat the Rich: <br> "A keen eye for ironic detail and an aphorist's wit."-The Wall Street Journal </p><p>"A funny, pungent paean to the glory of free enterprise"-Kirkus Reviews </p><p>"[O'Rourke's] brilliance is that he gets right to the heart of things."-The Boston Phoenix</p></p><h2>New Martinsville Glass, 1900-1944</h2><p>From Contents - Introduction; New Martinsville 1900-1907; Fisher Years; Clare Years; Description of Covers; Color Plates; McEldowney Years; Receivership and Renaissance; New Martinsville 1938-1944; Value Guide.

Only seven miles of water lay between the ship and the Union blockade. For Robert, his family, and his crewmates, reaching the blockade would mean a chance at freedom. <p>Growing up a slave in South Carolina, Robert Smalls had always dreamed of the moment freedom would be within his grasp. Now it was here, and all the lives aboard the Planter were in Robert's hands. With precision and daring, he would have to navigate past the forts ahead and steer the ship to the safety of the Union fleet. Just one miscalculation could be deadly, but for Robert and the others it was a risk worth taking. </p><p>Seven Miles to Freedom is a compelling account of the daring escape of Robert Smalls, a slave steamboat wheelman who would become one of the Civil War's greatest heroes.

"What a gripping adventure!" I thought, as I read about how Robert Smalls stole a Confederate steamboat right from under the noses of the Confederates and delivered it to the Union Navy. I was sure young readers would be as spellbound by his daring escape to freedom as I was. And at the same time, they would learn the story of an important African American hero seldom found in history books.JANET HALFMANN is the author of more than thirty books for children including several nonfiction and natural science titles.

Hart ,Published In India 1999, Pb, 572Pp</p><p>In 1978, when Michael Hart&#39;s controversial book The 100 was first published, critics objected that Hart had the nerve not only to select who he thought were the most influential people in history, but also to rank them according to their importance. Needless to say, the critics were wrong, and to date over 60,000 copies of the book have sold. Hart believed that in the intervening years the influence of some of his original selections had grown or lessened and that new names loomed large on the world stage. Thus, the publication of this revised and updated edition of The 100. As before, Hart&#39;s yardstick is influence: not the greatest people, but the most influential, the people who swayed the destinies of millions of human beings, determined the rise and fall of civilizations, changed the course of history. With incisive biographies, Hart describes their careers and contributions. Explaining his ratings, he presents a new perspective on history, gathering together the vital facts about the world&#39;s greatest religious and political leaders, inventors, writers, philosophers, explorers, artists, and innovators - from Asoka to Zoroaster. Most of the biographies are accompanied by photographs or sketches. Hart&#39;s selections may be surprising to some. Neither Jesus nor Marx, but Muhammad, is designated as the most influential person in human history. The writer&#39;s arguments may challenge and perhaps convince readers, but whether or not they agree with him, his manner of ranking is both informative and entertaining. The 100, revised and updated, is truly a monumental work. It promises to be just as controversial, just as thought-provoking, and just as successful as its predecessor - a perfectaddition to any history or philosophy reference section.<b>Michael H. Hart</b> is an American author and astrophysicist. His first and most famous book, <i>The 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History</i>, was published in 1978 and has sold more than half a million copies in 15 languages.</p><h2>In the Night Season: A Novel</h2><p>Nora Michaelson and her eleven-year-old son, Jason. are going through a difficult adjustment to life after the accidental death of Jason&#39;s father. at a time when the family&#39;s small business was failing. The loss of Jack Michaelson has left his wife and son nearly destitute. It has also placed their lives in jeopardy. This is a story of terror, and resourcefulness in the face of terror, from a master storyteller.</p><p>An 11-year-old boy and his recently widowed mother face dangers both internal and external in Richard Bausch's bloody but psychologically acute thriller. After a freak bus accident leaves Jack Michaelson dead and his family destitute, Nora and Jason Michaelson just barely scrape by. When their black neighbor Edward Bishop offers to drop in on Jason each afternoon, Nora is grateful--until Bishop finds a series of increasingly frightening hate letters stuffed into his mailbox, signed by an organization calling itself the Virginia Front. "Watch your step with the white woman," they warn, and, "The woman &amp; her son will burn with you." When two strangers break into Bishop's home, hog-tie, beat, and murder him, it's only natural that the police go looking for racists. Meanwhile, the real culprits go looking for Nora and Jason Michaelson. <p> Jack Michaelson was, as it turns out, a man of many secrets, and Nora and Jason's kidnappers expose them one by one. Even the villains here are fully fleshed out, their demons rivaled only by those of loneliness, family dysfunction, and greed. But make no mistake: this may be a "literary" thriller, but it's also a very scary one. The author of critically acclaimed short fiction and novels, including the comic gem <i>Good Evening Mr. &amp; Mrs. America, and All the Ships at Sea</i>, Bausch proves himself here as adept at building narrative tension and suspense. The characters don't always have the depth--or the appealing quirkiness--of those in Bausch's previous work, but what this novel lacks for in subtlety, it makes up for in sheer ominous power.</p><p>Richard Bausch is the author of nine other novels and seven volumes of short stories. His work has appeared in the <em>New Yorker</em>, the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>, <em>Esquire</em>, <em>Playboy</em>, <em>GQ</em>, <em>Harper's Magazine</em>, and other publications, and has been featured in numerous best-of collections, including the O. Henry Awards' <em>Best American Short Stories</em> and <em>New Stories from the South</em>. In 2004 he won the PEN/Malamud Award for Excellence in the Short Story.</p></p><h2>Involuntary Witness</h2><p><p>A nine-year-old boy is found murdered at the bottom of a well near a beach resort in southern Italy. In what looks like a hopeless case for Guido Guerrieri, counsel for the defence, a Senegalese peddler is accused of the crime. More than a perfectly paced legal thriller, this relentless suspense novel transcends the genre. A powerful attack on racism, and a fascinating insight into the Italian judicial process, it is also an affectionate portrait of a deeply humane hero.</p><p><b>Gianrico Carofiglio </b>is an anti-Mafia judge in Italy. This is his first novel, a bestseller in Italy and now the subject of a television series. It has won a number of prizes, including the Marisa Rusconi award.</p></p><p>Carofiglio, born in 1961, is an anti-mafia judge in Southern Italy. He is responsible for important trials concerning organized crime, corruption and the traffic in human beings. Involuntary Witness was his first novel, now followed by two more bestsellers. A critically acclaimed translator, known for his translations of Italo Calvino, Claudio Magris and Marcello Fois.A bestseller and winner of multiple awards in Italy, Carofiglio's debut should please fans of American-style courtroom thrillers. A murder case presents Guido Guerrieri, the archetypal burned-out defense lawyer, with a chance at redemption. A Senegalese peddler, Abdou Thiam, is arrested for killing a nine-year-old boy, whose body was found at the bottom of a well near a coastal resort in southern Italy. Even though the police have only circumstantial evidence against Thiam, he's advised to take a plea bargain that would allow him to get off with only 20 years in prison. Guerrieri becomes convinced that his new client is the victim of racism and is being used as a scapegoat. Defying conventional wisdom and putting his own career on the line as well as Thiam's fate, Guerrieri takes the case to trial. The result is a powerful indictment of the Italian justice system. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He has never left his home, a mysterious castle of seven towers. He does not see the threat that will tear apart his family and his world. But Tal cannot stay safe forever. When danger strikes, he must desperately climb the Red Tower to steal a Sunstone. He reaches the top...and then he falls into a strange and unknown world of warriors, iceships, and hidden magic. There Tal makes an enemy who will save his life--and who holds the key to his future.</p><p>Tal, a Chosen of the Orange Order, is having the worst luck lately. Just when he is getting ready for the Day of Ascension--a day when all the 13-year-old Chosen from the Castle of Seven Towers enter the spirit world of Aenir--his father disappears with the family's only primary Sunstone, which Tal needs for the ascension. Without it, he cannot enter Aenir and bind himself to a Shadowspirit--a kind of guardian being that serves as a friend and protector to the person it is bound to. And without a Shadowspirit, Tal will lose both his Chosen status and any hope of finding a cure for his mother's mysterious wasting illness, a cure that can only come from Aenir. Tal tries to beg, borrow, and even steal a Sunstone. But his attempts fail, and in his final act of thievery, Tal is thrown off the Castle of Seven Towers by a powerful Shadowspirit Keeper and into an adventure beyond his imagining. <p> Australian fantasy author Garth Nix (well known for his novels <i>Sabriel</i> and <i>Shade's Children</i>, both ALA list picks) has joined with Lucasfilm to launch a six-book fantasy series about Tal's world, of which <i>The Fall</i> is the first installment.

Striving to get ahead, self-criticism, fear, and hostility toward others seem to come more naturally to us. Yet researchers have found that developing kindness and compassion for ourselves and others builds our confidence, helps us create meaningful, caring relationships, lowers anxiety and hostility, and promotes physical and mental health.</p> <p> <i><b>The Compassionate Mind</b></i> reveals the evolutionary and social reasons why our brains react so readily to threats. Because of this tendency, it's easy to slip into anger, fear, and depression, and compassion can be difficult for us. This is not our fault. However, research has shown that our brains are also hardwired to respond to kindness and compassion. Building on this latest research, this book offers many practical exercises to help deepen compassion towards ourselves and others. Far from fostering emotional weakness, compassion subdues our anger and increases our courage and resilience to depression and anxiety. Wisely used, compassion arms us with the strength to pursue genuine happiness, peace of mind, and peace in the world.<br> <br> This book blends compassion focused therapy (CFT), attachment theory, neuroscience, and powerful mindfulness practices to help you develop a compassionate mind, and a better you.</p></p><p>Leading depression authority Paul Gilbert presents <b>The Compassionate Mind</b>, a breakthrough book integrating evolutionary psychology, new insights from neuroscience, and mindfulness practice.

King Henry V - the great Lion of England - is long dead. In 1437 his gentle son comes of age and takes the throne. Frail in body and mind, King Henry VI is dependent on his supporters to run his kingdom. Richard, Duke of York, however, believes that without a strong king England will fall. His fears seem justified as English power comes under threat from France, and discontent and rebellion spread at home. On the counsel of his advisers, Henry marries the young princess Margaret of Anjou, in order to forge an alliance with France - but is it too late? As the storm clouds gather, King Henry and his queen are besieged abroad and at home. Who can save the throne? Who will save the kingdom?

Accounting for biblical, theological and church-historical streams, Willard Swartley divulges a long tradition of healing and health care inherited by Christians today. Beginning with in-depth studies of Old and New Testament understandings of healing, the book surveys three millennia of biblical and theological teaching and practice in congregational life and mission. Along the way Swartley uncovers how Christians have understood the role of the church and other institutions in providing health and healing. The book concludes with an attempt to synthesize these biblical, historical and moral perspectives to help all Christians, including those in health care professions, respond to our current health care challenges.</p><p>Willard M. Swartley (Ph.D., Princeton Theological Seminary) is professor emeritus of New Testament at Anabaptist Mennonite Biblical Seminary. He formerly served as its dean and acting president and is an ordained minister in the Mennonite Church. Swartley has published several books and numerous academic articles and reviews."Willard Swartley has produced a fine book that will serve students, teachers, pastors and practitioners remarkably well as they consider the role of God and the church in human health care." (Frederick J. Gaiser, Interpretation: A Journal of Bible and Theology 68 (3))<br><br>"Any Christian providing health care or seeking healing could benefit from the first three quarters of Swartley's book. Those involved with US health care would especially benefit from the final quarter." (Steven D. H. Rasmussen, Missiology, 42 (1))<br><br>". . . a fine and comprehensive book." (Aaron W. Klink, Religious Studies Review, volume 39, number 3, September 2013)<br><br>"This book merits discussion within churches, especially those interested in missional approaches to ministry." (W. Rodman MacIlvaine III and D. Scott Barfoot, Bibliotheca Sacra, January-March 2014)<br><br>"I deeply appreciate the work Willard Swartley has done to help the church catch a vision for our participation in the health and healing of the world." (Tracy Taylor, Englewood Review of Books, Advent 2012)<br><br>"Swartley's holistic approach to the issue of health gives fresh perspectives on both healing in the Christian tradition and current issues of health care reform. Readers who are looking for ways to integrate contemporary questions about health care with a biblical and theological perspective that moves from text to tradition will find many valuable resources in Swartley's work." (Mary Veeneman, Ph.D., assistant professor of biblical and theological studies, North Park University)<br><br>"With an eloquent, rational approach, Willard Swartley critiques the current health care industry and persuasively offers a substantive alternative insight into health and healing by incorporating insights from Scripture, varied cultures, historic and religious practices, and contemporary trends. Swartley advances and amplifies the concept of shalom that embodies holistic health and reflects the biblical view of health. This vital and important volume will be valued by health care workers who aspire to experience how Christian faith can meaningfully transform their understanding and practice. I look forward to using this resource as a textbook for students in our biomedicine program." (Roman J. Miller, Ph.D., Daniel B. Suter Endowed Professor of Biology and director of the M.A. in Biomedicine Graduate Program at Eastern Mennonite University)<br><br>"Willard Swartley has done the Christian community a huge service by writing a comprehensive, thoughtful and lucid discussion on our biblical and moral responsibility to promote healing and to advocate for a just health care system. His argument goes beyond the usual economic, political and medical arenas by focusing on Christian healing, community and mission." (Mary J. McDonough, author of Can A Health Care Market Be Moral? A Catholic Vision)<br><br>"<em>Health, Healing and the Church's Mission</em> is a unique and refreshing contribution to the discussion of health, healing and the provision of health care. Its comprehensive look at the biblical perspectives and discussion of the moral dilemmas it awakens for all of us is much appreciated. An important read for any person of faith seeking for a biblical grounding on these issues." (Christine Sine, author and executive director of Mustard Seed Associates)<br><br>"Dr. Swartley clearly articulates the profound moral challenges facing the Christian church in response to many of the dilemmas of health care services in America. He does so through the lenses of a thoughtful treatment of biblical and theological perspectives and the rich history of Judeo-Christian engagement in health ministries of many forms. He highlights various alternative models of health services that may offer hope. This book is must reading for religious and institutional health care leaders who are willing to examine and are open to reclaiming the essence of God's reconciling and healing work in this world." (Rick Stiffney, president/CEO, Mennonite Health Services Alliance)</p><h2>Encountering John: The Gospel in Historical, Literary, and Theological Perspective (Encountering Biblical Studies)</h2><p>The uniqueness of the Gospel of John is readily apparent. In contrast to the overlapping material in the Synoptic Gospels, John shares only about ten percent of its content with Matthew, Mark, and Luke. John's distinct focus on Jesus' life as the culmination of salvation history makes it "the theological pinnacle of the gospel tradition" and establishes its author, along with the apostle Paul, as one of the early church's foremost theologians.<br><br>Not a traditional commentary on the book, this volume, like others in the Encountering Biblical Studies series, is designed especially for classroom use. A lucid writing style and a number of pedagogical enhancements make this a perfect tool for helping students master the content and key interpretive issues of the Gospel of John.<br><br>Like the other volumes in this series, the pedagogical usefulness of this work is enhanced by a number of features:<br><br>� copious illustrative tables, maps, and photos<br>� sidebars and excursuses that address difficult passages and important issues<br>� an outline and objectives at the beginning of each chapter<br>� study questions and key terms at the conclusion of each chapter<br>� a comprehensive glossary and annotated bibliography<br>� instructor's manual available on diskette</p><p>Andreas J. K�stenberger (Ph.D., Trinity Evangelical Divinity School) is associate professor of New Testament and Greek at Southeastern Theological Seminary. He is the author of The Missions of Jesus and the Disciples According to the Fourth Gospel. He is also the translator of the influential twovolume New Testament theology written by Adolf Schlatter.Arguably the Gospel of John is the most widely read gospel and at the same time the gospel which is the most difficult to understand. Students who look for a comprehensive introduction into the Fourth Gospel need to look no further. A. Kstenberger has written the best college level introduction available. The book is packed with the most recent scholarship yet is not pedantic in its presentation of secondary sources. It regulary discusses differing views on numerous topics yet never loses its focus. It consistently introduces the reader into scholarly debates not for their own sake but for enhancing the understanding of the text of the Gospel. It demonstrates an admirable balance between historical, literary, and theological matters. And it seeks to help the reader to engage with the Gospel and with the Incarnate Word whom it portrays, on a personal level. I highly recommend the book -- <i>Eckhard Schnabel, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School</i><br><br>Combines expert scholarship with skillful and attractive methods of communication. It is exactly what students of the Fourth Gospel need both to provide them with the scholarly information and to guide and stimulate their own exploration of the Gospel and the many issues it raises. A splendid contribution to this new series. -- <i>Richard Bauckham, St. Andrews University</i></p><h2>Faith and Doubt: An Anthology of Poems</h2><p><br><br>A collection of poems that explores why we believe and why, sometimes, we don't<br><br><i>What do you believe in? <br>What makes you doubt?</i><br>These are questions that people have grappled with since the beginning of time. Acclaimed anthologist Patrice Vecchione sees this struggle between faith and doubt in many places--from religion, to politics and war, to love, to the act of writing itself. Here she has gathered an extraordinary collection of poems that explore the many facets of human faith and doubt. <br><br></p><p><br><br>Patrice Vecchione is the editor of <i>Revenge and Forgiveness</i>, <i>Truth and Lies</i>, and <i>The Body Eclectic</i>, anthologies of poems for teenagers, as well as several adult anthologies. She is also a poet and teaches poetry to children and adults in schools, libraries, and community centers. Patrice lives in Del Rey Oaks, California.<br><br>Grade 8 Up&#x2014;As she did with <i>Revenge &amp; Forgiveness</i> (2004) and <i>Truth &amp; Lies</i> (2001, both Holt), Vecchione explores weighty topics in a wide-ranging anthology. Here she touches on faith and doubt of all kinds. Will teens believe as their parents do and as their friends do? Will they believe what their teachers or ministers or president tells them? Will their beliefs change during their lifetime? Is doubt something that can hurt them or make them more thoughtful? The editor also looks at faith and doubt as they influence writers and poets specifically, the struggle for words, the joy when they come, and the hope that some readers will be inspired to put words to paper. Over 50 poems, some by well-known writers, some by classical philosophers, some contemporary, some in English, others translated from 11 different languages, are included. Many of these poems will prompt thought and conversation. While some do deal with religion, others touch on everything from self-esteem to parents to nature. It's a diverse and well-rounded collection, balanced by both the insightful introduction and the brief but interesting biographies of the poets, which touch on the topics at hand.&#x2014;<i>Susan Oliver, Tampa-Hillsborough Public Library System, FL</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This conviction built our great nation and made it the star-spangled superpower that it is. But Bradley Trevor Greive (BTG) wants us to know when enough's enough!

It has also caused premature aging, unsightly baldness, and explosive indigestion and is responsible for a lot of very questionable fashion statements.<br><br>Too many people drive themselves beyond reasonable limits to do more, have more, and be more. BTG points out that ironically, they actually end up with a lot less. "It's like climbing mountain after mountain and never taking the time to look at the view," he says.<br><br>With his trademark combination of engaging animal photos, gentle humor, and priceless insights, BTG urges us to have the courage to say <i>No</i>, and to learn to use this liberating two-letter word in a way that is amusing and empowering, but never offensive.

But Daniel doesn't have a normal life. He is the protector of the earth, the Alien Hunter, with a mission beyond what anyone's imagining.<br> From the day that his parents were brutally murdered before of his very eyes, Daniel has used his unique gifts to hunt down their assassin. Finally, with the help of The List, bequeathed to him in his parents' dying breath, he is closing in on the killer.<br> Now, on his own, he vows to take on his father's mission--and to take vengeance in the process.</p><p>Daniel X works alone. <p>Having watched from the shadows as the brutal events of the murder of his own parents unfolded before him, he has been forced to make his own way in a dark and unforgiving world with a heavy task handed to him. </p> <p>Daniel�s father was an alien hunter, working his way through a fearsome �wanted� list of aliens intent on seeking control and wreaking devastation. But as he planned his next target, his own time was running out. Following his parents� sudden deaths, Daniel faced an uncertain future: he knew little about his family nor where he came from but a few things are clear, he has inherited the list from his father and with it, a unique ability to create anything that he needs including some very devoted friends to help him along the way. </p> <p>His life has become dedicated to the mission.

It does not want to advertise its detention system that coddles enemy fighters while putting American soldiers at risk. It does not want to reveal the new lawyered-up Pentagon war ethic that prosecutes U.S. soldiers and Marines while setting free spies who kill Americans.This very system ambushed Captain Roger Hill and his men.Hill, a West Point grad and decorated combat veteran, was a rising young officer who had always followed the letter of the military law. In 2007, Hill got his dream job: infantry commander in the storied 101st Airborne. His new unit, Dog Company, 1-506th, had just returned stateside from the hell of Ramadi. The men were brilliant in combat but unpolished at home, where paperwork and inspections filled their days.With tough love, Hill and his First Sergeant, an old-school former drill instructor named Tommy Scott, turned the company into the top performers in the battalion. Hill and Scott then led Dog Company into combat in Afghanistan, where a third of their men became battlefield casualties after just six months. Meanwhile, Hill found himself at war with his own battalion commander, a charismatic but difficult man who threatened to relieve Hill at every turn. After two of his men died on a routine patrol, Hill and a counterintelligence team busted a dozen enemy infiltrators on their base in the violent province of Wardak. Abandoned by his high command, Hill suddenly faced an excruciating choice: follow Army rules the way he always had, or damn the rules to his own destruction and protect the men he&#39;d grown to love.</p><p>LYNN VINCENT is a New York Times bestselling author and investigative journalist.

The Dogon are best known for their religious traditions, their mask dances, wooden sculpture and their architecture. All of this has made Dogon country one of Mali&#39;s major tourist attractions. Dogon art is primarily sculpture that revolves around religious values, ideals, and freedoms. Dogon sculptures are not made to be seen publicly and are commonly hidden from the public eye. The importance of secrecy is due to the symbolic meaning behind the pieces and the process by which they are made. Themes found throughout Dogon sculpture consist of figures with raised arms, superimposed bearded figures, horsemen, stools with caryatids, women with children, figures covering their faces, women grinding pearl millet, women bearing vessels on their heads, donkeys bearing cups, musicians, dogs, quadruped-shaped troughs or benches, figures bending from the waist, mirror-images, aproned figures, and standing figures. They are unique in African art, but show similarities in the works of modern Western artists as diverse as Picasso, Modigliani, Giacommetti, and the German expressionists. How did this happen? In this book, Jean Laude, the distinguished French scholar, deals with this question and the entire problem of approaching the study of the art of so-called primitive societies by classifying the sculpture of the Dogon on the basis of technical, formal, thematic, and stylistic criteria, illustrating his text with photographs of the examples in the Lester Wunderman Collection, perhaps the finest and most complete assemblage of Dogon sculpture in private hands. By considering the works in the context of what little is known about Dogon history. Jean Laude enables us to understand the complexities of their symbolic content and function, as we appreciate the remarkable aesthetic quality that places them on the highest level of great sculpture of the world.</p><p>Text: English (translation)</p><h2>Eastward to Tartary: Travels in the Balkans, the Middle East, and the Caucasus</h2><p>At its peak, the Ottoman empire stretched from Hungary to the Gulf of Aden to the Caspian Sea. Informed by a lifetime of travel and exploration, Eastward to Tartary takes you on a spellbinding journey into the heart of that still-unsettled region, a journey over land and through history.<br><br>Seven years ago, Robert Kaplan published a book on an obscure corner of Eastern Europe that many Americans had never heard of. That book, Balkan Ghosts, became a classic of travel writing, a landmark work whose eloquence is matched by its influence. Eastward to Tartary is in part a sequel. Kaplan takes us through Turkey, across the Fertile Crescent, and into the volatile, oil-rich lands of the Caucasus and Central Asia, a region he describes as the Balkans of the future--explosive, strategically important, the new fault line between East and West.<br><br>Through dramatic stories of unforgettable characters past and present, Kaplan illuminates the tragic history of the lands in which he travels. He ventures from the famed archaeological ruins of Syria to the markets of Lebanon to the military outposts of Turkey and Israel; from Baku, capital of new business and new oil, across the Caspian Sea to the deserts of Turkmenistan and back to the killing fields of Armenia.<br><br>Eastward to Tartary is Kaplan's first book since Balkan Ghosts to focus on a single region--one that is as mystifying as it is mysterious. This enthralling book will introduce Americans to countries as unfamiliar to them now as the Balkans once were, as dangerous, and as important.</p><p>The master of the hardheaded travelogue, Robert D. Kaplan returns with a book on what he calls "the New Near East," an area stretching from the Balkans to Central Asia that "might become the seismograph of world politics" in the new century. That doesn't sound like good news: "The pitiless history of the Near East [is] dominated by marauding armies and earthquakes while peace treaties have merely formalized temporary stalemates on the ground." Kaplan has made a career of writing about the world's trouble spots "without illusions"--his books <i>Balkan Ghosts</i> and <i>The Ends of the Earth</i> are at once influential and pessimistic. <p> <i>Eastward to Tartary</i> is a fascinating exploration of places Kaplan has not written about in depth before: "Third World Europe" (Romania and Bulgaria), Turkey, Syria, Jordan, and the confusing conglomeration of countries and peoples in the Caucasus. Smart observations leap off almost every page. "In every Arab city I have ever visited, people were polite and honest, running after you to return a loose coin you have left at a soft-drinks stand," he writes. So why hasn't democracy taken hold in the Islamic world? "The very perfection of the Islamic belief system begot a naive absolutism that made the compromises of normal political life impossible." In an aside on ancient Assyria, Kaplan notes, "The theme is always the same: Highly militarized and centralized states and empires, so indomitable in one decade or generation, hack themselves to pieces or are themselves conquered in another." Then he reminds readers that Assyria once bestrode present-day Iraq and Syria--a "hauntingly appropriate" coincidence.

But when you are very young, there are some things that you just know, and the little boy knows that one day a carrot will come up. So he waters his seed, and pulls the weeds, and he waits ...</p> <p>First published in 1945 and never out of print, this timeless combination of Ruth Krauss's simple text and Crockett Johnson's eloquent illustrations creates a triumphant and deeply satisfying story for readers of all ages.</p></p><p>Ruth Krauss, author of <i>A Hole Is to Dig</i>, has crafted a story almost Zen-like in its simplicity. A little boy plants a carrot seed and waits patiently, tending to it carefully, while everyone around him insists that "it won't come up." His conviction is steadfast, however, and sure enough, a carrot worthy of first prize at any state fair springs forth from the earth. Krauss's husband, Crockett Johnson (creator of <i>Harold and the Purple Crayon</i>), illustrated <i>The Carrot Seed</i>, and while the little boy is rendered with uncomplicated lines, all of his hope, confidence, and serenity shine through. The image that resonates most strongly in this minimalist tale is the unfaltering faith of the mild-mannered little boy. Young readers learn that standing your ground in the face of opposition and doubt can often result in twice the reward expected (even thrice the reward, if judging by the girth of this carrot). <i>(Ages 4 to 8)</i><p>When you are very young,<br>there are some things that you just know....<br></p><p>This treasured story of childhood faith<br>rewarded is now avaliable in a board book<br>edition for the youngest child.</p></p><h2>A Brief History of Seven Killings</h2><p>Brief History of Seven Killings</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, October 2014:</strong> This is a book that I did not expect to enjoy. Having finished it&#x2014;and feeling, as I do now, that <i>A Brief History of Seven Killings</i> is one of the best books I&#x2019;ve read all year&#x2014;I went back and identified the reasons why I did not expect to like it. Reason #1&#x2014; <i>The story is an oral history told in multiple voices</i>: that&#x2019;s true, but James&#x2019; enormous talent makes the multiple voices work. Reading the novel is an immersive experience&#x2014;the characters are real, they are engaging, and James uses them to look at all sides of the story. Yes, the multiple points-of-view are difficult at first, but each voice quickly distinguishes itself as unique and important; the payoff is a novel of sweeping scope and emotion. Reason #2&#x2014;<i>Many of the characters speak in Jamaican patois</i>: like many readers, I&#x2019;m not a big fan of dialect on the page. Tell me what they say, not necessarily how they say it. But James pulls it off with remarkable ease. I expected the patois to start to grate once I got further into the book. It never did. The language only added to my understanding of the story and its characters. Reason #3&#x2014;<i>Violence</i>: this is not an easy book, particularly when it comes to violence. It starts early, and there&#x2019;s a lot of it (certainly more than seven killings). But it&#x2019;s there for a reason. By showing the violence, the poverty, and the struggle to survive in 70s Jamaica, James illustrates how the ghetto can change a person. Over time, we see how every man and woman is changed. Reason #4 &#x2013;<i>It&#x2019;s about Jamaica</i>: I hesitate to admit that I wasn&#x2019;t initially interested in a book set in Jamaica. Am I just not interested in a world so different from mine? Whatever the underlying reason, I was wrong to think that way. I could take the easy route and say that this novel is about something more than Jamaica, but that seems obvious. All I can say is: these people were real to me. And like all great novels, James&#x2019; work drew me in, entertained me, and changed me in ways I could not have anticipated. &#x2013;<i>Chris Schluep</i></p>MARLON JAMES was born in Jamaica.

And from the look the female bank teller was giving him as he stood in line at the First Savannah Savings and Loan to cash a check, she would have been perfectly happy to help him strip.<br><br>John felt her gaze but was ignoring all the signals. Not only was he not in the mood for dallying with a stranger, she was wearing a wedding ring&#x2014;a big no-no for him. He shifted from one foot to the other, then looked down at the two little boys clinging to the legs of the woman in front of him and grinned. The oldest one smiled back, while the younger one continued the exploration of his right nostril with his index finger.<br><br>"Hi," the older one said. "My name is Brandon Dog-gett." He pointed toward the little guy. "That's Trevor Doggett. He's my little brother." Then he pointed at his mother's backside, which John had already noticed was quite shapely. "That's my mama. Her name is Doggett, too."<br><br>When Mama Doggett realized her name was being bandied about, she glanced over her shoulder to see who her son was talking to. Her eyes widened slightly as she saw John Nightwalker's face. The smooth coffee skin, high cheekbones, strong chin and nose were telling of his Native American heritage, but it was the sexy smile and glint in his eyes that stopped her breath. She might be married, but she wasn't dead and the man was stunning.<br><br>"I hope the boys aren't bothering you," she said.<br><br>John grinned. "No, ma'am."<br><br>"Daddy calls her Lisa," Brandon offered.<br><br>Lisa Doggett rolled her eyes as John chuckled.<br><br>The low, husky rumble of his laugh made the female teller lose count of the cash she'd been dispensing. With pink cheeks and a muttered apology to her customer, she began again.<br><br>Lisa Doggett, being next in line, finally reached the teller and proceeded with her business. When they were done, the teller handed each little boy a lollipop, which they promptly peeled and popped into their mouths. Lisa flashed John a shy goodbye smile and started toward the front door with her sons in tow.<br><br>Being next in line, John moved up to the window, patiently waiting as the teller keyed in some data from her previous customer. There was a moment of silence&#x2014;a soft, peaceful sound of shuffling feet and the distant murmurs between loan officers and their clients&#x2014;then John felt the atmosphere change. To him, the room was suddenly stifling and charged with an anger he didn't understand.<br><br>"Sir. How can I help you?" the teller asked, but John didn't respond.<br><br>His gaze went from Lisa Doggett and her boys, who were on their way toward the exit, to the surrounding customers waiting in line. Suddenly one of the two boys cried out, then turned around and ran. John noticed a toy car in the middle of the lobby and figured it had fallen out of a pocket. He saw the mother's irked expression turn to one of quiet patience as she waited for her son's return.<br><br>His attention moved from them to the rest of the crowd. At first glance, no one stood out, and then his gaze fell on a tall, heavyset man standing in line on the other side of the lobby. He was wearing a pair of faded Levi's and a heavy denim jacket. The jacket seemed out of place, considering the outside temperature was in the high eighties. That alone immediately set him apart. The man's lower jaw jutted from his face like a bulldog's&#x2014;a strong protruding lower jaw that extended beyond the tip of a nose that had obviously been broken more than once. His skin was ruddy, his hair a brittle yellow color. John could feel the tension emanating from him. He didn't know what was going to happen but sensed it wouldn't be good.<br><br>As he continued to watch, the big man headed toward a teller, walked up to the window and slid what appeared to be a white cotton bag across the counter. It looked like an ordinary deposit bag, but when the teller's face turned pale and her eyes widened in shock, John tensed.<br><br>He could see the man's lips moving, but he was too far away to hear what was being said. All of a sudden the teller's eyes rolled back in her head as she dropped to the floor in a faint. Everyone heard the thud as her head collided with the hard marble floor. The teller next to her screamed out for help as everything ground to a halt.<br><br>Wallace Deeds cursed beneath his breath, unable to believe what had just happened. In all the years he'd been doing this, he'd never had anyone faint on him before. He was a criminal, but he wasn't stupid. At this point, his best bet was to retrieve the note he'd handed to the teller and calmly walk out of the building. To his dismay, the note was no longer on the counter. It was on the floor beside the unconscious woman.<br><br>"Crap," Wallace muttered, and slid his hand in his pocket, taking comfort from the gun he could feel inside. He glanced up and around, quickly sizing up the number of people inside the bank against his need for dough. He opted for a hasty exit.<br><br>But his plan was screwed by a secretary who'd come to the unconscious teller's aid. She was on her knees beside the woman and feeling for a pulse when she discovered the note.<br><br><i>I have a gun. Put all your money in the bag and keep quiet or you're a dead woman.</i><br><br>Unaware that he'd been made, Deeds was already heading toward the door when the secretary stood up and screamed.<br><br>"Stop him! He has a gun!"<br><br>Wallace cursed and turned. The bank guard was pulling out his pistol and coming toward him on the run. Without thinking, Wallace grabbed the nearest customer by the arm and put her in a choke hold as he pulled out his own gun and fired a shot into the ceiling.<br><br>"Everyone on the floor! Now!" he screamed.<br><br>The bank guard stood his ground, still aiming his weapon and shouting, "Drop the gun! Drop it! Drop it and let her go!"<br><br>John groaned. The hostage was none other than Lisa Doggett, the young woman with the two little boys who'd been in line in front of him.<br><br>Bad move. Bad, bad move.<br><br>The young mother's panic was evident as she cast a frantic, wild-eyed gaze at her little boys. Trevor, the youngest, began to cry and started toward her.<br><br>"Don't anybody move!" Wallace roared, waving the gun at the guard, then at the kids and back again.<br><br>John knew the man was a hair's breadth away from shooting someone, whether he meant to or not, and Trevor Doggett's determination to get to his mother was putting him in harm's way. There was no time for John to think about the wisdom of his actions.<br><br>In one swift move, he pulled a knife from his boot and leaped forward, desperate to draw the gunman's attention away from the boys, his hostage and the guard with the gun, knowing full well that he was going to get shot. Knowing full well it was going to hurt like hell&#x2014; but it wasn't going to kill him.<br><br>That was the edge he had over everyone else in the room. He'd faced death and cheated it countless times over the last five hundred years and had every confidence in the world that he was going to cheat it again.<br><br>When Wallace Deeds saw the movement from the corner of his eye, he swung his pistol. A man was coming at him on the run.<br><br>"Son of a bitch!" he screamed, then fired.<br><br>The shot went straight into John's chest. He felt the impact and a sharp, searing pain, but he didn't go down.<br><br>When Deeds' hostage fainted and went limp, she became a liability instead of a shield. Disgusted, he shoved her aside and squeezed off another shot. But it was the knife suddenly protruding from his chest that sent his second shot into the ceiling next to the first.<br><br>A collective gasp rose from inside the bank, followed by a silence so stark that everyone froze.<br><br>Lisa Doggett had come to and was on her knees, shielding her children with her body.<br><br>The tellers had ducked behind the counter.<br><br>The people who'd dropped to their bellies when the shooting started were staring but not moving.<br><br>No one ran.<br><br>No one spoke.<br><br>But the ones who could see were staring in disbelief at the two giants standing in the middle of the lobby&#x2014;both bleeding profusely&#x2014;waiting to see who dropped first.<br><br>The pistol slipped out of Deeds' hand as he reached toward the bone handle of the knife stuck in his chest. But the moment he touched it, he shuddered. Had someone poured hot oil into his chest? He looked up. People's faces were blurring.<br><br>"How..." He sighed, then staggered backward.<br><br>John groaned as he put a hand to his own chest. The warm gush of his blood was already slowing as he watched the gunman fall. Wallace's head hit the tile with a sickening crack, but he never felt it. He was already dead.<br><br>The bank guard holstered his weapon and started toward John.<br><br>Lisa Doggett was shaking, but she was alive and her children were safe.<br><br>People were getting up and yanking out their cell phones, anxious to tell their loved ones what had just happened. While on his belly, one customer had videoed the whole thing with his cell phone, and now he was in the act of forwarding it to his brother. The image of what had transpired would be all over the Internet before nightfall.<br><br>Horace Miles, the bank president, was moving through the crowd, making sure everyone was okay. When he saw the blood on the front and back of John's shirt, he gasped and yelled for someone to call 911.<br><br>John was anxious to be gone before he had to explain why the bullet hole in his chest was already nearly closed. He pulled his knife out of the robber's chest, then wiped the blood off the blade onto the man's jacket before slipping it back into the sheath inside his boot.<br><br>The bank guard reached John and took him by the elbow.<br><br>"You need to sit down, son," he said. "You've been shot."<br><br>"I'm okay," John said.<br><br>"The police are coming!" someone said.<br><br>Sirens could be heard in the distance. John sighed. He needed to leave&#x2014;now. He started toward the door, but Horace Miles cut him off. Like the guard, he took John by the elbow and tried to usher him to a chair.<br><br>"Please," Miles said. "You're bleeding. Let us help you."<br><br>"I'm all right... really."<br><br>But the bank president would have none of it.<br><br>Lisa Doggett came toward him, hugging her little boys to her legs as she stared at him in disbelief.<br><br>"You saved my life. You saved all of us," she whispered. "Thank you. <i>Thank you."</i><br><br>"Yeah... sure," he said, then gave in to the inevitable. He was caught now, and there was no way out of it.<br><br>The two little boys stared at him&#x2014;silent now in the face of what they'd witnessed.<br><br>"Mama's okay, boys," John said softly.<br><br>Brandon nodded. "You stopped the bad man," he said.<br><br>John just winked and nodded. The pain in his chest was fading swiftly, but the sirens were also getting closer. Moments later, a half-dozen police cars were on the scene, followed by two ambulances. A paramedic team followed the police inside, then, at the guard's direction, headed for John.<br><br>He sighed. How the hell was he going to explain his way out of this?<br><br>"I'm okay," he said as the paramedics dropped their bags and began to cut off his shirt. "I said... I'm okay," he repeated, and to prove he was right, he pulled up his shirt, revealing the wound that was almost closed.<br><br>Both paramedics rocked back on their heels, staring at John and then at each other.<br><br>"Mister... how in&#x2014;"<br><br>"Er... uh... I studied with the Dalai Lama," John said.<br><br>"Learned how to control bleeding and heal myself with my mind. Ever hear of it?"<br><br>They looked at each other, shrugged, and then began packing up their gear while sneaking curious looks at him.<br><br>But they weren't the only ones staring. The bank president was in shock. He'd seen the bullet pierce John's chest, seen the blood spurting, yet now the wound was nearly closed. He'd seen the other scars on John's chest, too, and was staggered by what this man had suffered and lived through.<br><br>Just when John was getting ready to leave, a skinny man in a suit followed several uniformed officers into the bank, paused long enough to question the guard, then headed straight for John, who recognized the type, as well as the badge clipped to the man's belt.<br><br>Great. A detective. Naturally nosy, disinclined to believe anything he was told. This ought to be good.<br><br>John saw him pause to look at the dead man; then he looked straight at John, who stared back without flinching.<br><br>Horace Miles stepped into the silent breach by introducing himself as the cop approached.<br><br>"I'm Horace Miles, president of the bank. I saw everything."<br><br>"Detective Robert Lee," the newcomer said, then put his hands on his hips and gave John the once-over, eyeing the bloody shirt as well as the blood on John's jeans. "So, hero, what's your name?"<br><br>Sarcasm was the last thing John expected. It made him angry. He stood abruptly, well aware that he was now towering over the skinny man's head.<br><br>"Considering the fact that right now, my chest hurts like hell, I don't appreciate your sarcasm," he drawled. "My name is John Nightwalker, and I'm not a hero. I was just in the wrong place at the right time."<br><br>Lee wanted to be pissed, but the man was right. "Sorry," he said. "That came out wrong. Let's back up and do this all over again. So, Mr. Nightwalker, could you tell me what happened?"<br><br>John pointed to the walls where a half-dozen cameras were mounted. "I could... but it appears that Mr. Miles here will be able to provide several different angles on the incident for your viewing pleasure. Suffice it to say, the man tried to rob the bank, took a woman hostage and was pointing his gun at one of her kids. I distracted him. He shot me instead of the kid. I put a knife in his chest."<br><br>Believing John had already been tended by paramedics, Lee's next thought was the weapon in question. "May I see that knife?"<br><br>John winced as he leaned over, pulled up the leg of his jeans, then pulled the knife back out of its scabbard.<br><br>The detective's eyes widened and his mouth dropped as he eyed the wicked blade. It was almost ten inches in length, with its widest point no less than three inches across. The handle appeared to be some kind of bone&#x2014; maybe ivory. He frowned.<br><br>"Hell, mister, that thing's big enough to fight bears with."<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>Startled by the easy answer, Lee gave John a cool look. "Don't tell me you fight bears, too?"</p><h2>The Funny Thing (Wanda Gag Classics)</h2><p>Kind old Bobo changes the Funny Thing, an &#34;aminal,&#34; from a doll-eater to a jum-jill-eater</p><p>Wanda Gg (1893-1946) was born in New Ulm, Minnesota, the daughter of an artist and the eldest of seven children.

She now combines knitting with crochet in her freeform work.Nov 07 Freeform knitting and crochet is all about taking risks, working outside your comfort zone and trying new and unusual techniques, yarns, ideas to create something truly unique. Jenny Dowde is a strong advocate of this style, and warns that you will quickly become addicted! Her new book introduces the basics of design, from colour wheels to geometry, along with explaining many different freeform techniques. Also included are 25 inspiring projects including scarves, hats and jewellery which illustrate her ideas and encourage you to develop your own. This book is perfect for someone looking to take their first steps into design. Don&#39;t be hesitant - take your yarn in your hands and jump! * Simply Knitting * Sept 08 I was very excited about the author&#39;s first book on this subject, `Freeform Knitting and Crochet&#39;, but it didn&#39;t go quite as far as I had hoped it would. This new volume, however, is far closer to the book I had initially hoped for. There are expanded sections on design and colour theory, and more helpful motifs and versatile principles to adapt according to your own taste. There are still a few projects to follow if you like, but in my opinion, this title is a far more practical guide to freeform knitting and crochet than its predecessor. Together, it would be fair to say they make a winning team!

Mieko loves to do calligraphy more than anything, but now she can barely hold a paintbrush. And she feels as if she has lost something that she can&#39;t paint without-the legendary fifth treasure, beauty in the heart. Then she is sent to live with her grandparents and must go to a new school. But Mieko is brave and eventually learns that time and patience can help with many things, and may even help her find the fifth treasure.</p><p><b>Eleanor Coerr&nbsp;</b>was born in Kamsack, Saskatchewan, Canada, and grew up in Saskatoon. Two of her favorite childhood hobbies were reading and making up stories.&nbsp;Eleanor began her professional life as a newspaper reporter and editor of a column for children. Luckily, she traveled to Japan in 1949 as a writer for the <i>Ottawa Journal</i>, since none of the other staff wanted to go to a country that had been devastated by war. Coerr is the writer of numerous children's book and picture books.Grade 3-5-- The four treasures of traditional East Asian calligraphy are brush, inkstick, inkstone, and paper. The "fifth treasure," as Mieko's art teacher has told her, is beauty in the heart, which breathes life into writing word-pictures (characters). Mieko lived in a village outside Nagasaki when the atom bomb was dropped. Flying glass badly damaged her writing hand and now, a few months later, she has been sent to live with her grandparents. Ashamed of her scars and certain she has lost the fifth treasure, Mieko withdraws into herself, rejecting school and her grandparents' efforts to help her heal psychologically. It is the subtle, beneficial influence of her new friend, Yoshi, and her overbearing aunt that helps Mieko overcome her fears and start to face life again. The child's inner and outer conflicts are believably handled, and readers will identify with her struggle towards normalcy after trauma. Much of the plot is obvious, but satisfying. The meeting with Yoshi's aunt is especially heavy-handed. With the plot unfolding in the months immediately after surrender, with Tokyo in ashes, rationing for nearly a decade, the collapse of the economy, and U. S. occupation forces just settling in, the fact that she blithely orders (and receives) luxury writing paper is a strain on credibility. Otherwise, this is a warm, sensitive, and well-written story with wide appeal. --John Philbrook, San Francisco Public Library<br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Virals</h2><p>Adventure is in Tory Brennan's blood.

It was how he stood, back to the bleached sun, and the way the clouds poured under his draping sleeves and upraised palms, like a man standing on the sky. His trembling voice rose above the din of bleating goats, crackling wood, screaming infants, and wailing mothers. &#x201c;God is love. It is a love that purifies, a love that sanctifies, a love that unites us.&#x201d; Carden&#x2019;s pale blue eyes passed over the piteous, howling mob, prostrated in the mud, barricaded by monks in red robes.<br> <br>&#x201c;And God sees,&#x201d; Carden continued, &#x201c;and today he smiles. Because we have done His work today. We have washed ourselves clean with God&#x2019;s love. We have seared away the rotten flesh.&#x201d; The clouds of smoke billowing around Carden&#x2019;s arms and legs swirled with flakes of red ash. Spit flecked his lips. &#x201c;Sawed away the corruption of demonism. Expelled the blackened humors from this land. God smiles today!&#x201d; As Carden lowered his arms, his draping sleeves dropped away like curtains, revealing an inferno of thirty burning crosses in the field behind him. The crucified were hard to see in the thick black smoke.<br> <br>Biette, a sturdy block of a woman and mother of four, rose up like a wounded bear and hobbled on her knees toward Carden before one of the tonsured monks in red stepped forward, planted his boot between her shoulder blades and kicked her face-first into the mud. And there Biette stayed, groaning into the wet earth.<br> <br>Nimue&#x2019;s ears had been ringing since she and Pym rode into the village on Dusk Lady and saw the first dead body on the trail. They thought it might&#x2019;ve been Mikkel, the tanner&#x2019;s boy, who grew orchids for the May rituals, but his head had been crushed by something heavy. They could not even stop to check, for the entire village was on fire and Red Paladins swarmed, their billowing robes dancing with the flames. On the fallow hill, a half-dozen village elders were already burning to death on hastily erected crosses. Pym&#x2019;s screams had seemed far away to Nimue as her mind went white. Everywhere she looked, she saw her people being choked in the mud or torn from their homes. Two paladins dragged old Betsy by her flailing arms and hair through her pen of geese. The birds squawked and fluttered in the air, adding to the surreal chaos. Shortly thereafter, Nimue and Pym were separated, and Nimue took shelter in the straw pile, where she held her breath as monks stomped past her carrying blanket bundles of confiscated goods. They unfurled the blankets on the floor of the open wagon where Carden stood, spilling the contents around his feet. The priest looked down and nodded, expecting this: roots of yew and alder, wooden figurines of elder gods, totems, and animal bones. Carden sighed patiently. &#x201c;God sees, my friends. He sees these instruments of demonic conjuring. You cannot hide from Him. He shall dredge this poison out. And shielding others like you will only prolong your suffering.&#x201d; Father Carden brushed ashes from his gray tunic. &#x201c;My Red Paladins are eager for your confessions. For your sakes, offer them freely, for my brothers are deft with the tools of inquisition.&#x201d;<br> <br>The Red Paladins waded into the mob to single out targets for torture. Nimue watched as family and friends clawed over one another to avoid the paladins&#x2019; reach. There were more screams as children were pried from their mothers&#x2019; grips.<br> <br>Unmoved, Father Carden stepped down from the wagon and crossed the muddy road to a tall and broad-shouldered monk in gray. His cheeks were lean beneath his cowl, and strange black birthmarks were blotted around his eyes and ran down his face like streaming tears of ink. Nimue could not hear their words for the shouting around her, but Carden rested a hand on the monk&#x2019;s shoulder, like a father, and pulled him into a whisper. Head bowed, the monk nodded several times in response to Carden&#x2019;s words. Carden gestured to the Iron Wood; the monk nodded a final time, then climbed onto his white courser.<br> <br>Nimue turned to the Iron Wood and saw ten-year-old Squirrel standing in the monk&#x2019;s path, bewildered, blood dribbling down his cheek as he dragged a sword behind him. At this, Nimue burst from the straw pile and charged at Squirrel. She heard the Gray Monk&#x2019;s hoofbeats getting louder behind her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nimue!&#x201d; Squirrel reached for her, and she yanked him against the wall of a hut as the monk thundered past.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t find Papa!&#x201d; Squirrel cried.<br> <br>&#x201c;Squirrel, listen to me. Go to the hollow in the ash tree and hide there until it&#x2019;s night. Do you understand?&#x201d;<br> <br>Squirrel tried to pull away from her. &#x201c;Papa!&#x201d;<br> <br>Nimue shook him. &#x201c;Squirrel! Run now. As fast as you can. Are you listening!&#x201d; Nimue was shouting into his face. Squirrel nodded. &#x201c;Be a brave one. Run like you do in our fox races. No one can catch you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No one,&#x201d; Squirrel whispered, summoning the courage.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the fastest of us all.&#x201d; Nimue swallowed back tears, for she did not want to let him go.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll come?&#x201d; Squirrel pleaded.<br> <br>&#x201c;I will,&#x201d; Nimue promised, &#x201c;but first I have to find Pym and Mother and your father.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I saw your mother near the temple.&#x201d; Squirrel hesitated. &#x201c;They were chasing her.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ice coursed through Nimue&#x2019;s veins at this news. She shot a look to the temple at the top of the rise. Then she turned back to Squirrel. &#x201c;Fast as the fox,&#x201d; she commanded.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fast as the fox,&#x201d; Squirrel repeated, tensing as he shot furtive glances left and right. The nearest paladins were too occupied with the beating of a resisting farmer to notice them. So without a look back, Squirrel shot across the pasture for the Iron Wood.<br> <br>Nimue lunged into the road and ran for the temple. She slid and fell in the mud dredged up from horses and blood. As she climbed to her feet, a horseman suddenly swung around from one of the burning huts. Nimue barely saw the ball of iron whip around on its chain. She tried to turn away, but it caught her at the base of her skull with such force it sent her nearly airborne into a pile of firewood. The world unglued as stars burst behind Nimue&#x2019;s eyes and she felt warm liquid stream down her neck and back. Splayed out on the ground, firewood all around her, Nimue saw a longbow snapped in two pieces beside her. The broken bow. The fawn. The council. Hawksbridge.<br> <br>Arthur.<br> <br>It seemed impossible that only a day had passed. And as she lost consciousness, one thought left her choking with dread: this was all her fault.</p><h2>Marfa Modern: Artistic Interiors of the West Texas High Desert</h2><p>Twenty-one houses in and around Marfa, Texas, provide a glimpse at creative life and design in one of the art world&#x2019;s most intriguing destinations. <br> &nbsp;<br> When Donald Judd began his Marfa project in the early 1970s, it was regarded as an idiosyncratic quest. Today, Judd is revered for his minimalist art and the stringent standards he applied to everything around him, including interiors, architecture, and furniture. The former water stop has become a mecca for artists, art pilgrims, and design aficionados drawn to the creative enclave, the permanent installations called &#x201c;among the largest and most beautiful in the world,&#x201d; and the austerely beautiful high-desert landscape.<br> &nbsp;<br> In keeping with Judd&#x2019;s site-specific intentions, those who call Marfa home have made a choice to live in concert with their untamed, open surroundings. <i>Marfa Modern</i> features houses that represent unique responses to this setting&#x2014;the sky, its light and sense of isolation&#x2014;some that even predate Judd&#x2019;s arrival. <br> &nbsp;<br> Here, conceptual artist Michael Phelan lives in a former Texaco service station with battery acid stains on the concrete floor and a twenty-foot dining table lining one wall. A chef&#x2019;s modest house comes with the satisfaction of being handmade down to its side tables and bath, which expands into a private courtyard with an outdoor tub. Another artist uses the many rooms of her house, a former jail, to shift between different mediums&#x2014;with Judd&#x2019;s Fort D. A. Russell works always visible from her second-story sun porch. <br> &nbsp;<br> Extraordinary building costs mean that Marfa dwellers embrace a culture of frontier ingenuity and freedom from excess&#x2014;salvaged metal signs become sliding doors and lengths of pipe become lighting fixtures, industrial warehouses are redesigned after the area&#x2019;s white-cube galleries to create space for private or personally created art collections, and other materials are suggested by the land itself: walls are made of adobe bricks or rammed earth to form sculptural courtyards, or, in one remarkable instance, a mix of mud and brick plastered with local soils, cactus mucilage, horse manure, and straw.</p><p>Helen Thompson is a nationally known writer whose areas of specialty include interior design, architecture, and food.

The idea of 'a place where the demand to live for art is so compelling as to be unavoidable' might sound hyperbolic, but when readers see how these residents live, they'll understand."<br>&#x2014;<i><b>Publishers Weekly<br></b></i><br>"Thompson&#x2019;s clear, brief essays describe how each homeowner arrived in Marfa&#x2014;a nice contextual touch, given that it&#x2019;s a remote place where residents and visitors have to decide very consciously to be. Her descriptions of plans, materials, and design concepts give heft to what could have simply been a lifestyle coffee table book. Photographer Casey Dunn leaves people and styling (extraneous food, flowers, and props) out of his shots, for the most part, which keeps the focus on design choices as well as the play of the desert light inside. The result is a visual page-turner and is clearly a result of Thompson&#x2019;s reporting skills from her days at <i>Metropolitan Home</i> magazine. <i>Marfa Modern</i> serves as a primer on how a &#x201c;watering hole&#x201d; that [Donald] Judd put on the map has evolved without him, and lets it lay claim to importance as a place of vernacular design, not solely an art destination."<br>&#x2014;<i><b>Architectural Record</b></i><br><br>"Each of 21 houses showcases a different response to the landscape&#x2014;from artful transformations of a former service station and a onetime jail to new builds with 360-degree views.

Helen Thompson describes the architecture as intensely personal, an oddball mix of funky vibes with ultra-modern art: 'Each home is a site-specific construction that exists in the spirit of Judd's command to make art suit its space. In the best sense, the thoughtful creatives who have settled lately in Marfa carry on the tradition of Marfa as Donald Judd saw it&#x2014;as a place where the demand to live for art is unavoidable and compelling.'"<br>&#x2014;<b><i>Styleblueprint</i></b></p><h2>Seeing Angels: How to Recognize and Interact with Your Heavenly Messengers</h2><p>A recent study found that 57 percent of Catholics, 66 percent of Evangelical Protestants, and 10 percent of Jews have reported having a personal experience with a guardian angel.

There is nothing else remotely like it, in flavor, personality and technique. It was slow food before there was slow food -- a yeast-less bread with a colorful American past going back to early pioneer days in the hills of Appalachia. (It might be the first "mountain-to-table" bread.) Over time, the knowledge was nearly lost, but now a new generation of bakers is rescuing the tradition. </p> <p>For <i>Salt Rising Bread</i>, expert bakers Susan Brown and Jenny Bardwell set out to rediscover the secrets and the science behind the bread's "wild microbes," unique fermentation and memorable taste. Their search took them from the parlors of Appalachian bread-making elders to the laboratory of a renowned pathologist -- to the pages of rare cookbooks, bread museums and pioneer diaries. <i>Salt Rising Bread</i> is a richly illustrated, recipe-filled treasure of American culinary lore.</p></p><p>Genevieve Bardwell and Susan Ray Brown live and work in the Appalachian communities where salt rising bread has been a part of life for nearly 300 years. To more deeply understand this beloved heritage bread, the authors have spent over 20 years extensively researching its history, lore and science. Their quest has taken them to archives, scientific labs, bakeries and bread museums across the United States and Europe &#x2013; and into the kitchens and living rooms of hundreds of expert salt rising bread bakers. Genevieve owns and operates Rising Creek Bakery, which specializes in salt rising bread and ships hundreds of loaves weekly throughout the U.S. She graduated from the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York, then earned a Masters in Plant Pathology. Susan grew up in southern West Virginia. She learned to make salt rising bread from her grandmother, whose own mother and grandmother had passed on this time-honored family tradition. Together, the authors keep this nearly lost tradition alive through the bakery, classes, Susan's Salt Rising Bread Project website, and this book.Authors Genevieve Bardwell and Susan Ray Brown posit in their excellent, small-but-jampacked book that salt rising bread has its roots in the hills and hollers of that storied mountain region. The book combines oral history from longtime salt rising bread bakers &#x2015; indeed, Bardwell's Rising Creek Bakery in Mount Morris, Pa., specializes in salt rising bread &#x2015; with tips for success and recipes for both the bread and dishes prepared with it.

The miracle of Kristi Coulter&#x2019;s narrative is that it looks back at the reader and asks, &#x2018;And how do <i>you </i>live?&#x2019; <i>Nothing Good Can Come from This</i> seems to speak for a whole generation, and it does so with great charm and brilliance.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;Charles Baxter, author of <i>The Feast of Love</i><br><i></i><br>"Kristi Coulter&#x2019;s <i>Nothing Good Can Come from This</i> is powerful medicine&#x2015;healing in its fearlessness and elegant in its form. It is an inspiring account of a human being committed to examining her own life and mind in the midst of a toxic and tuned-out contemporary culture, and is recommended reading for anyone interested in doing the same.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;Bonnie Nadzam, author of <i>Lamb</i> </p><p>&#x201c;Kristi Coulter says all the things you&#x2019;re not supposed to say and points out all the things you&#x2019;ve kind of noticed but never quite articulated. <i>Nothing Good Can Come from This</i> is equal parts hilarious and poignant, beautiful and wise. These are clear-eyed, fresh, and vital essays about addiction, sex, money, love, and the messy, terrifying work of being a person in this world.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;Diana Spechler, author of <i>Skinny</i> and <i>Who by Fire</i><br><i></i><br><i></i>&#x201c;<i>Nothing Good Can Come from This</i> is a refreshing, candid, and very funny look into the life of a woman trying to learn how to be sober in a world that seems to want everyone to keep drinking. In unapologetic and deeply intelligent prose, Kristi Coulter exposes her own flaws while also turning a critical eye to our alcohol-drenched culture. This book is about sobriety, but it&#x2019;s even more about a woman trying to define herself on her own terms, outside the frames of work, sex, and family.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;Tom McAllister, author of <i>How to Be Safe</i></p></p><h2>Will&#39;s Best: Celebrating the 20th Anniversary of The New York Times Puzzlemaster: 400 Crossword Puzzles and Introduction by Will Shortz</h2><p><p>In 1993 Will Shortz became the puzzle editor for The New York Times and crosswords have never been the same!

In this 1931 Wall Street classic Neill explains not only how to read the tape, but also how to figure out what&#39;s going on behind the numbers. Full of graphs and charts, it contains excellent sections on human nature and speculation. Though first published in 1931, this work remains a classic text in the field, and greatly influence Nicholar Darvas, a later Wall Street Guru. Neill advised that the investor not follow the general public and he himself was very wary of the crowd mentality. Neill&#39;s philosophy pushes the reader to study hard and pay ones&#39; dues. He insists that the successful trader is an educated entrepreneur; one who can make reasoned decisions based on the movements of price and volume.</p><p>Humphrey Neill, the celebrated sage of Saxtons River, Vermont, has inspired generations of contrarians. His advice to investors: Beware of the crowd, don&#39;t be swept up by euphoria or down by despair. When everyone thinks alike, watch out. They&#39;re probably wrong. Neill&#39;s sharp thinking and homespun aphorisms are no less appropriate today than when he began to formulate the theory of contrary opinion three quarters of a century ago. In fact, Neill&#39;s ideas formed the basis for the Contra Fund that Fidelity Management established in 1967 and still manages today.</p><h2>Antarctica: A Guide to the Wildlife (Bradt Travel Guide)</h2><p>Updated throughout, the 7th edition of Bradt's <em>Antarctica: a Guide to Wildlife</em> is the most practical guide to the flora and fauna available for those &#x2018;going south'. Celebrating the amazing and often unique species of this spectacular environment, the title features chapters on the region's famous whales and penguins, and also on lesser known species such as skuas and sheathbills, with full coverage of plumage and identification. Each chapter is accompanied by vibrant illustrations from Dafila Scott to help bring species to life. Tony Soper's immaculate and engaging text remains the indispensible choice for the intrepid wildlife enthusiast.Antarctica's wildlife is under threat. The Southern Ocean is warming and the most obvious effect is on the continental ice shelves. Spectacular retreats and monster carvings from the west coast of the peninsula have been seen in recent decades. Less ice means fewer krill, which depend on the ice-edge for the algae which nourish them. In turn, this will impact on seal and whale numbers. In the case of penguins, while kings and macaronis, for instance, are doing well, the magnificently adapted and truly Antarctic species, Ad�lies and emperors, are in decline. In the case of emperors, maybe by as much as 50%.Bradt's <em>Antarctica</em> not only helps you to identify and understand species and habitats, it also explains the issues faced by this extraordinary continent, regarded by many as one of the most precious places on the planet.<br></p><p>The storm-tossed Southern Ocean and the inhospitable landscape of Antarctica combine to form one of the last true wildernesses on earth. They are also home to vast numbers of animals, from the tiny shrimps of the zooplankton to the penguins, albatrosses, seals and great whales for which this extraordinary region is justly famed. In this fully revised edition of Antarctica: A Guide to the Wildlife, Dafila Scott's sensitive illustrations combine with Tony Soper's lively text to create a unique guide and a book that will give lasting pleasure. Whether you are a dedicated naturalist or an expedition member in search of a deeper understanding of the continent, this is the ideal companion. <br>Tony Soper was first bowled over by Antarctica when he sailed the furious fifties as lecturer in the pioneer tourist vessel World Discoverer in 1992. Lucky to get the job, his knowledge of southern ocean wildlife would have gone comfortably on a postage stamp. Looking for a pocket guide to the birds to find there was no such thing, he set to and carried a pile of 4x3 cards (this was not only before the internet, it was before decimalisation). On return, he persuaded his chum Hilary Bradt (they sailed the Indian Ocean together) that those filecards needed upgrading to paperback, decorated with superb watercolours by Dafila Scott (who had better Antarctic connections). And he upgraded his ship job to become Expedition Leader for subsequent seasons, sailing in Russian research vessels, designed for work in ice-infested coasts and manned by men with unrivalled experience of ice navigation. Like the trans-hemisphere Arctic tern, he migrated annually to the deep south after that first baptism, crossing the dreaded Drake Passage many dozens of times to enjoy the endless excitement and pleasures of exploring the spectacular scenery and the world of penguins and great whales. In those early days the reward was to be sailing waters which were poorly-charted but with undiscovered wildlife treasures, finding new routes to remote islands with penguin-rich beaches and those bays and backwaters where stranded icebergs make for wonderful zodiac cruises and chances to find yourself alongside whales and basking seals.Today, the Antarctic season is home for a visiting flotilla of expedition ships, from small vessels carrying fifty hardy explorers to enormous luxury vessels carrying more than a thousand in search of a polar treat. For the fullest experience, he advises choice of a ship which offers beach landings and zodiac cruises. And be aware that the Expedition Leader will have great influence on the success of your trip. Reading the Bradt guide at least guarantees an introduction to the wonderful wildlife without the disadvantage of crossing the Drake in a westerly storm and five-metre waves.<br>Dafila Scott is an artist and zoologist, member of the Society of Wildlife Artists and 'Scott of the Antarctic's' grand-daughter.</p><h2>Breadcrumbs</h2><p><p>The winner of numerous awards and recipient of four starred reviews, Anne Ursu's <em>Breadcrumbs</em> is a stunning and heartbreaking story of growing up, wrapped in a modern-day fairy tale.</p><p>Once upon a time, Hazel and Jack were best friends.

St Helen&#39;s</h2><p>Studies the eruption of Mount St. Helens, its impact on scientific knowledge, and the gradual return of life to its barren slopes</p><p><b>Patricia Lauber</b> is the author of the Around-the-House series and more than 125 other books for young people. Her <i>Volcano: The Eruption and Healing of St. Helens</i> was a Newbery Honor Book. She lives with her husband and two cats, Beemer and MeToo, in New Canaan, Connecticut.Grade 4-8 After the eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980, a number of fine books for young readers appeared which discussed at length this catastrophe, the devastation it created, and the geologic forces which caused it. Although providing less detail in these areas, Lauber brings the other titles up-to-date by describing the biological succession and geological changes which have since occurred at Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument. This provides an excellent example of the interdependence of all plant and animal life. How the Earth itself creates new environments for living things which in turn reshape the Earth is demonstrated visually as well as verbally. The captioned high-quality color photographs are well-integrated with the text, superbly illustrating the written material. This volume is more suited to younger readers than the Aylesworths' The Mount St. Helens Disaster (Watts, 1983) and Goldner's Why Mount Saint Helens Blew Its Top (Dillon, 1981), and is more current.

His columns in <i>Time</i> magazine and his commentaries on PBS's News Hour with Jim Lehrer have made him a household word and a trusted friend of millions. With a wry sense of humor and inimitable wit, Rosenblatt offers here guidelines for aging that are both easy to understand and, more importantly, easy to implement. <br><br>More and more in the news today, we are hearing about phenomenal advances in the "fight against aging." But what Rosenblatt suggests to combat age is far more valuable than any scientific breakthrough-he breaks down the hardest part of aging, the mental anguish of growing older with fifty-four gems of funny, brilliant, wise, indispensable advice. <br><br>A book to savor, a book to keep, and a book for all ages.<br><br>This little guide is intended for people who wish to age successfully, or at all. . . . One may think of this work as a how-to book, akin to many health guides published these days, whose purpose is to prolong our lives and make them richer. That is the aim of my book, too. -from the Introduction<br><br>And this is just the start of Roger Rosenblatt's charming and thought-provoking guide to surviving the episodes that shamelessly shave years off of our lives. With a wry sense of humor and peerless wit, Rules for Aging provides guidance that is, hands down, the most practical, pleasurable and, most importantly, painless advice you'll ever receive. As Rosenblatt writes, "When I urge you to refrain from a certain thought or course of action, I do not mean to suggest that you are in any way wrong if you do the opposite. I mean only to say that you will suffer."<br><br>Rule #1: It doesn't matter<br>Whatever you think matters-doesn't. Follow this rule, and it will add decades to your life. It does not matter if you are late, or early; if you are here, or if you are there; if you said it, or did not say it; if you were clever, or if you were stupid; if you are having a bad hair day, or a no hair day; if your boss looks at you cockeyed; if your girlfriend or boyfriend looks at you cockeyed; if you don't get that promotion, or prize, or house, or if you do. It doesn't matter.<br></p><p>What? A how-to-make-your-life-better-book with more than the ubiquitous seven ways of doing so? In <i>Rules for Aging: Resist Normal Impulses, Live Longer, Attain Perfection</i>, acclaimed essayist and <i>NewsHour with Jim Lehrer</i> regular contributor Roger Rosenblatt boldly offers up a whopping 56 rules for wisely navigating life into your golden years.<p> Rosenblatt describes the short book (only 140 pages), which began with a column he wrote for <i>Modern Maturity</i>, as a "little guide intended for people who wish to age successfully, or at all." He adds that "growing older is as much an art as it is a science, and it requires fewer things to do than not to do."</p><p> Ranging from the fatalistic (rule 1: "It doesn't matter") to the highly practical (rule 26: "Never go to a cocktail party and, in any case, do not stay more than 20 minutes"), rule 2 best illustrates the tone for much of what follows ("Nobody is thinking about you"):</p><p> </p><blockquote>Yes, I know, you are certain that your friends are becoming your enemies; that your grocer, garbage man, clergyman, sister-in-law, and your dog are all of the opinion that you have put on weight, that you have lost your touch, that you have lost your mind; furthermore, you are convinced that everyone spends two-thirds of every day commenting on your disintegration, denigrating your work, plotting your assassination. I promise you: Nobody is thinking about you. They are thinking about themselves--just like you.</blockquote><p> Other notables include "Let bad enough alone" (rule 3), "Stay clear of anyone--other than a clergyman--who refers to God more than once in an hour" (rule 8), "Do not attempt to improve anyone, especially when you know it will help" (rule 29), "The unexamined life lasts longer" (rule 40), "Change no more than one-eighth of your life at a time" (rule 48), and "The game is played away from the ball" (rule 55). Nowhere will you find talk of antioxidants or exercise or anything resembling a detox program. Rosenblatt is no health nut, and there is already plenty of material available on that. What you will encounter instead is a gifted writer clearly enjoying his craft, making this slim volume a welcome poke at and departure from the more predictable antiaging fare. <i>--Patrick Jennings</i></p>Published in hardcover by Harcourt, 2000, 0-15-100659-8 <br></p><h2>Geronimo: The True Story of America&#39;s Most Ferocious Warrior</h2><p>First published in 1906, <i>Geronimo</i> is the collaborative work between Geronimo, chief of the Chiricahua Apache, and author S.

This is often the question that comes to mind when we confront real suffering in our own lives or in the lives of those we love. Pastor Gregory A. Boyd helps us deal with this question honestly and biblically, while avoiding glib answers. Writing for ordinary Christians, Boyd wrestles with a variety of answers that have been offered by theologians and pastors in the past. He finds that a fully Christian approach must keep the person and work of Jesus Christ at the very center of what we say about human suffering and God's place in it. Yet this is often just what is missing and what makes so much talk about the subject seem inadequate and at times even misleading. What comes through in <em>Is God to Blame?</em> is a hopeful picture of a sovereign God who is relentlessly opposed to evil, who knows our sufferings and who can be trusted to bring us through them to renewed life.</p><p>Gregory A. Boyd (Ph.D., Princeton Theological Seminary) is a pastor at Woodland Hills Church in St. Paul, Minnesota. Previously, he was a professor of theology at Bethel University, also in St. Paul. His books include <em> Recovering the Real Jesus in an Age of Revisionist Replies, Letters from a Skeptic, God of the Possible, Repenting of Religion, Seeing is Believing, Escaping the Matrix, The Jesus Legend, Myth of a Christian Nation, Is God to Blame, God at War</em> and <em>Satan and the Problem of Evil</em>."Boyd argues forcefully that, for Christians, the deepest revelation of God's character has to be the cross of Christ, where God's glory is revealed not as compelling power but as sacrificial love. . . . For Boyd, the mystery of suffering resides not in God's inscrutable will or a possible 'dark streak' in God's character, but in the complexity of a universe where freedom and risk are realities that even God must experience. Always compassionate, sometimes cantankerous, and capturing biblical concepts with memorable clarity, this challenging book should be a valued resource for pastors, counselors, support groups, and individual study." (Publishers Weekly (starred review) August 25, 2003)<br><br>"Greg Boyd addresses what may be the single most asked question among skeptics and seekers. Many without Christ are still waiting for us to respond with an intelligent answer. Greg provides an apologetic that actually makes sense about an issue that really matters!" (Erwin Raphael McManus, Lead Pastor, Mosaic, Los Angeles)<br><br>"In this new book from the pen of pastor-theologian Greg Boyd, we discover an answer to one of life's most difficult questions: If God is good, why do bad things happen? Boyd advances a radical notion: human history is a battle between God and Satan. We are part of this struggle, and what the future holds is (in part) up to us. Things are not all fixed from eternity. Agree or disagree, Boyd makes Christian faith exciting. I recommend this book to thoughtful Christians everywhere." (Alan G. Padgett, Professor of Systematic Theology, Luther Seminary)<br><br>"In this stimulating work, Gregory Boyd shows how an incarnational theology focuses on God's action in Jesus Christ as the source for our knowledge of God. In Jesus we see what God does for us, how God loves us, how God feels for us and how God rescues creatures and creation.

While these engines are well known for their durability and longevity, they still require a rebuild at some point. How to best diagnose, repair, and rebuild these engines is somewhat of a mystery for those without access to the factory manuals until now. <p>This book covers the vast majority of Powerstroke Diesel engines on the road, and gives you the full story on their design. Each part of the engine is described and discussed in detail, with full-color photos of every critical component. A full and complete step-by-step engine rebuild is also included. </p><p>The book's appeal extends further with a wide range of engine-building tips, charts, graphs, and information-packed sidebars to share even more information.

Or picked one up, held it to our ear, and then gazed in wonder at its shape and hue? Many a lifelong shell collector has cut teeth (and toes) on the beaches of the Jersey Shore, the Outer Banks, or the coasts of Sanibel Island. Some have even dived to the depths of the ocean. But most of us are not familiar with the biological origin of shells, their role in explaining evolutionary history, and the incredible variety of forms in which they come. <br><br>Shells are the external skeletons of mollusks, an ancient and diverse phylum of invertebrates that are in the earliest fossil record of multicellular life over 500 million years ago. There are over 100,000 kinds of recorded mollusks, and some estimate that there are <i>over a</i><i>million more </i>that have yet to be discovered. Some breathe air, others live in fresh water, but most live in the ocean. They range in size from a grain of sand to a beach ball and in weight from a few grams to several hundred pounds. And in this lavishly illustrated volume, they finally get their full due.<br><i><br>The Book of Shells </i>offers a visually stunning and scientifically engaging guide to six hundred of the most intriguing mollusk shells, each chosen to convey the range of shapes and sizes that occur across a range of species. Each shell is reproduced here at its actual size, in full color, and is accompanied by an explanation of the shell&#x2019;s range, distribution, abundance, habitat, and operculum&#x2014;the piece that protects the mollusk when it&#x2019;s in the shell. Brief scientific and historical accounts of each shell and related species include fun-filled facts and anecdotes that broaden its portrait. <br><br>The Matchless Cone, for instance, or <i>Conus cedonulli</i>, was one of the rarest shells collected during the eighteenth century. So much so, in fact, that a specimen in 1796 was sold for more than six times as much as a painting by Vermeer at the same auction. But since the advent of scuba diving, this shell has become far more accessible to collectors&#x2014;though not without certain risks. Some species of <i>Conus</i> produce venom that has caused more than thirty known human deaths.<br><br>The Zebra Nerite, the Heart Cockle, the Indian Babylon, the Junonia, the Atlantic Thorny Oyster&#x2014;shells from habitats spanning the poles and the tropics, from the highest mountains to the ocean&#x2019;s deepest recesses, are all on display in this definitive work.</p></p><p><b></b><p><b>M.

Over the years, many people have commented on how the vignette presented in the beginning of the book opened their eyes to what their assessments might be like for the children they assessed. The vignette is presented again in this revised edition to illustrate how different the assessment process can be for children and families. Chapter 1 in the <i>Administration Guide</i> discusses why theory, research, and legislation are now dictating that assessment of young children should be natural, functional, and responsive to child and family needs.</p><p><b>TRADITIONAL ASSESSMENT</b></p><p>Imagine yourself as a 3-year-old child who has been referred to a developmental center for assessment because of suspected developmental delays. Both your mother and father have come with you to a place called "the Center."</p><p>When you walk in the door, a woman meets you and takes you to her office. You sit on your mom's lap while the woman behind the desk asks your mom and dad questions about your birth and your first 3 years of life. Your mom and dad sound worried and your mom even cries when she talks about you. You feel sad and think that something about you must be making her cry.</p><p>After a while, another woman comes to take you to "play some games." Your mom and dad tell you to go with the "nice lady" and it will be fun. The nice lady takes your hand. You walk down the hall with her to a small room with a table and two wooden chairs and some pictures on the wall. You don't see any games anywhere. Then the lady pulls out a suitcase and starts to put things like blocks and puzzles in front of you. She then asks you to do certain things with them. At first this is fun, but after a while the lady asks you to do some things that are not so much fun. It's hard. You tell her this, but she just keeps putting things that are not fun in front of you. She also asks you questions that you can't answer. You want to go back to your mommy and daddy, but the lady keeps saying that you'll be finished soon. "Soon" is a long time. Finally, the lady says that you're all done playing games. You feel relieved! This lady doesn't know much about how to have fun!</p><p>After a necessary potty break and a few tears, the lady lets you see your mommy and daddy. But not for long. Here comes another lady to take you to another little room with another table and chairs and different pictures on the wall. This lady doesn't talk much. She just keeps putting pictures in front of you and asking you what they are. Many of the pictures are things that you have seen, but you just don't know what to call them. So you look down at the floor and up at the pictures on the wall. You pull on your shirt and wiggle a lot. You wish this lady would quit with the pictures. You've seen more than enough pictures. Then the lady gets out another suitcase, only it's a different color. She pulls out a couple of toys at a time and tells you what she wants you to do with them. Some of these are neat toys, and you'd really like to play with them. Every time you start to do something other than what the lady told you to do, however, she takes the toys away. This lady sure is stingy. You are getting tired, so you put your head down on the table. The lady makes you sit up. Finally, she is through. She takes you back to your mommy and daddy and tells them that you were "somewhat resistant."</p><p>Mom and Dad look worried, so when they ask, you tell them you had fun playing games with the ladies. That was a mistake. In the car they tell you that you are coming back tomorrow for some more games! When you tell them you don't want to go back, you didn't like the ladies, they say tomorrow you will play with another nice lady.</p><p>Wrong. The next day a man comes out to meet you. He says you are going to play some more fun games. You are not convinced. This time you go to a big room with many stairs and boards that wobble and boards that don't wobble and hanging nets and balls and all kinds of neat stuff. You think that maybe this will be fun! You run and jump and climb the stairs and are generally having a great time. Then the man puts you up on a big ball and tries to make you fall off. At least that is how it feels, though the man keeps saying he won't let you fall. You don't trust him. You want your mommy and daddy, so you cry. Then the man makes your arms and legs go different directions and bounces you around some. This doesn't seem fun anymore. The man is nice enough. He just doesn't know when to stop! You cry louder, and finally the man says, "We've had enough for today." He's right about that.</p><p>You go back to your mommy and daddy who are still sitting with that worried look on their faces. They tell you that they will take you to get a hamburger for being so good. You don't tell them that you weren't really that good. They don't need to know everything.</p><p><b>TRANSDISCIPLINARY PLAY-BASED ASSESSMENT</b></p><p>You are still the same 3-year-old child who has been referred for evaluation due to suspected developmental delays. As you enter the Center, you are greeted by the same woman who came out to your house to talk to your mommy and play with you. This time, however, she takes you to a large room containing many different toys. A playhouse is in one corner, an area with blocks and cars is in another, a table with puzzles and little toys is in another, and a water table with toys is in another. Wow! All your favorite things!</p><p>Hey! This place is neat! Mommy is holding your hand, but you let go and run to the dollhouse area. It has a sink, refrigerator, and stove just like at home, only smaller. And it has dolls and beds and dishes and telephones. You look in the refrigerator. There's a birthday cake with candles! Suddenly you notice another lady next to you. She says, "Oh, you found the birthday cake!" She doesn't even seem to mind when you take the cake out of the refrigerator and pull out all of the candles. "Maybe we should invite some babies to a party," she says. "Yeah!" You pick up a doll and give her a piece of cake. The lady does the same thing with her baby. She says her baby is hungry. You say your baby is hungry. too. Well, actually, you say "ungy," but she seems to understand. She pours more "milk" in your baby's cup. You and the lady play together in the house. Sometimes she does what you do, and sometimes you look at her and do what she does. You think she is a nice lady.</p><p>All of a sudden you remember your mommy and daddy. You look around and see them sitting there watching you. They are talking to the other lady. A man is also watching you and he has a video camera. You say "hi" to Mommy and Daddy. The lady hands you a telephone and tells you Mommy and Daddy are on the phone. You talk to Mommy and Daddy, who say, "Hi, are you having fun playing?" Then you talk to the lady who is playing with you. The two of you have lots of fun dressing the dolls for bed, brushing their teeth, combing their hair, and putting them to bed. Every once in a while you check to see if Mommy and Daddy are still there. They are</p>. <p>A little boy comes into the playhouse. You don't know who invited him, but he wants to play with the toys, too. The play lady says he wants to play with you. As long as he doesn't take your doll, it's okay with you. He plays with the dishes and cooks. He pours juice and gives you some. You take it but go back to putting your doll to bed. The play lady gives the boy some dishes and he puts them on the table. He says that dinner is ready, so you go to the table with your baby. You feed your baby. The boy talks to you, but you don't answer. You just don't feel like talking to him. After a while he wanders off to play somewhere else. That's okay with you.</p><p>Then the play lady goes over to the water table with her doll and starts to wash her doll. That looks like fun, so you go, too. You wash the doll for a while, and then you play with the water wheel, boats, funnels, and other fun stuff. When you get tired of this, you go over to see what's in the block area. This is fun, too. You and the play lady build bridges, drive cars over a road, put gas in your cars, have a car crash, and get the cars fixed. This place sure has nice toys.</p><p>Your mommy and daddy tell you they are leaving to get a cup of coffee and they'll be right back. You watch them go and are a little worried, but you don't mind staying here with the play lady. After a few minutes Mommy and Daddy come back, and Daddy comes over to play with you. You show him the cars, and you both drive them and crash them off bridges and laugh. Then Mommy comes over to show you some things at the table. The two of you put puzzles together. Some of them are hard and Mommy helps you. Mommy is a good helper. Then you and Mommy draw pictures, count the lines you drew and read a book. It's fun to have Mommy and Daddy playing too.</p><p>When you're all done with your pictures and puzzles, the play lady takes all of you to another room with stairs, boards that wobble, boards that don't wobble, hanging nets, balls, and tricycles. You run and jump and climb up and down the stairs. The play lady throws the ball to you and your daddy and mommy. You get the play lady to follow you up and over and through things. This play lady sure is a good sport! When she looks all worn out, you give her a rest. You try to ride the tricycle, but it's too hard. The play lady and your daddy toss you around in the air. You play with a big ball, and you and Daddy take turns bouncing and rolling on it.</p><p>After everyone is all worn out, including you, all of you go back to the playroom. There is a snack of crackers and juice in the middle of the table and the little boy is there. The play lady lets you pour the juice and put yellow cheese on the crackers. You give some to the boy and take some for yourself. You try to give some to Mommy and Daddy, but they don't seem too interested. The play lady talks to you and the boy. You ask the boy if he wants more. He seems to be a pretty nice boy after all.</p><p>After you're all done eating and drinking, the play lady says it's time to go. You are tired, but you'd still like to play with those cars some more. The play lady says maybe another day. That sounds good to you. How about tomorrow?</p><p><b>ALMOST 20 YEARS LATER</b></p><p> Although much has changed since 1990, rigid testing procedures are still used, and even required, in some states. TPBA is the same in many ways, but it has evolved as well. Now TPBA may be done just as easily in the home, in a classroom, or in a community setting. Parents may be the primary play facilitators more frequently, and they will have more involvement before, during, and after the assessment. The process, however, remains much the same: a child- and family-friendly assessment resulting in practical, meaningful information. Whereas the <i>Administration Guide for TPBA2 &amp; TPBI2</i> describes the total TPBA process and administration, including discussion of how to obtain preliminary information, presentation of strategies for talking to families and facilitating play with children, and ways to summarize data and integrate them into a report, this volume, <i>Transdisciplinary Play-Based Assessment, Second Edition</i> (TPBA2), includes detailed chapters with research and literature describing significant aspects of each domain. These chapters are extensive, providing a review of the literature for each of the subcategories as well as guidelines for observation and interpretation of information obtained. Extensive Age Tables are also provided, noting age ranges for acquisition of skills and the outer ages by which time a skill should be demonstrated. These chapters provide the heart of the TPBA2 assessment process. They should be read carefully so that the rationale for the TPBA2 Observation Guidelines and the implications for services and intervention needs are fully understood. The third volume of this system, <i>Transdisciplinary Play-Based Intervention, Second Edition</i>(TPBI2), presents a process for planning, implementing, and evaluating intervention for children from birth to 6 years of age who need supports to enhance their development by providing a framework for conceptualizing intervention strategies and a means for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the strategies selected.</p></p><h2>True Crime: The Novel</h2><p>In the heat of the city, a man is out of time: speeding in a beat-up Ford Tempo, blasting easy-listening music. Reporter Steve Everett drinks too much, makes love to his boss's wife, and has just stumbled upon a shocking truth: a convicted killer is about to be executed for a crime he didn't commit.<br><br>In the cold confines of Death Row, Frank Beachum is also out of time. Ready to say good-bye to the wife and child he loves and hello to the God he still believes in, Beachum knows he did not kill a convenience store clerk six years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;But in a few hours&#x2014;if Steve Everett can't find the evidence to stop it&#x2014;a needle is going to pierce Frank Beachum's skin.<br><br>The killing machine is primed. The executioner is waiting. And so is the priest. Now the clock is ticking down and the race is on&#x2014;between the reporter and his demons, between the system and its lethal flaws, between the last innocent man and society's ultimate crime. . . .</p><p><i>True Crime</i> is an edge-of-the-seat suspense novel that graphically portrays the final moments leading up to a condemned killer's appointment with the executioner. The plot is familiar but convincing: An inmate, Frank Beachum, denies any involvement in the murder of a young pregnant woman. His only chance for survival lies in the hands of a reporter, Steven Everett. From the very first page, however, veteran suspense writer Andrew Klavan does everything possible to make this journalist unlikable--he drinks too much, he's committed adultery. In fact, the incarcerated Beachum, who stands accused of a hideous crime, comes across as a much more decent person than Everett. <p> Foes of capital punishment will find in <i>True Crime</i> another buttress to the oft-expressed argument that state-sanctioned murder is not always just, that some police investigations are sloppy even when they're not politically tinged or racially motivated, and that exonerating evidence is often overlooked. Here such evidence is so glaringly overlooked that it's possible for a somewhat drunken reporter with plenty of other things on his mind (a wife who's about to leave him and a boss who's just discovered that Everett is cuckolding him) to spot the inconsistencies. He follows a hunch, discovers the identity of the real killer, and tries to clear Beachum's name as the minutes tick away. The relentless pace and Klavan's crisp, taut writing make the suspension of disbelief possible, and no doubt Clint Eastwood, who stars in the movie version, will make Steven Everett a more likely and likable hero. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>"Time flies when you're having fun, waiting to die, or reading <i>True Crime,</i> Andrew Klavan's nerve-plucking suspense novel...A beat-the-clock suspense thriller."<br><i>--The New York Times Book Review</i><p>"A classic . . . <i>True Crime</i> moves like a tornado, its plot turning in tighter and tighter circles until it explodes in an ending that will leave readers exhausted. . . .

Earl A. Grollman, the award-winning author of <i>Living When a Loved One Has Died</i>, explains what to expect when you lose someone you love.</p><p><b>Dr. Earl A. Grollman</b>&nbsp;a pioneer in the field of crisis intervention, was rabbi of the Beth El Temple Center in Belmont, Massachusetts, for thirty-six years. A certified death educator and counselor, he was cited as "Hero of The Heartland" for his work with the families and volunteers of the Oklahoma City bombing. Dr. Grollman has spoken at many colleges, clergy institutes, seminaries, physicians' forums, and hospital nursing associations, and has addressed many support groups, such as Compassionate Friends, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, and Widows Personal Services. He has also appeared on national television and radio, including&nbsp;<i>The Oprah Winfrey Show, Children's Journal, All Things Considered,</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Mister Rogers' Neighborhood.</i>&nbsp;Recently, he was featured on National Public Radio's&nbsp;<i>End of Life</i>&nbsp;series in the roundtable discussion on grief and bereavement.An insightful theologian/grief expert (``the cure for grief is to grieve'') opens with Terry Kettering's attention-grabbing poem, ``The Elephant in the Room.'' Teens' grief--like, Grollman suggests, the huge (but unobserved) elephant--is often overlooked or minimized. Addressing this gap, he presents just a few on- target, incisive lines on each page--to be read, like poetry, with deliberation--on topics such as ``the first days after a death'' and ``facing your future.'' The occasional humor is not inappropriate (``Why is there a special relationship between grandparents and grandchildren? They have a common enemy--the parent''); but the treatment of special relationships and circumstances suffers from Grollman's brevity. He acknowledges that it's normal to feel that one's own grief is the worst; some teens will be disappointed not to find their particular situation treated more fully. Still, all are likely to find consolation in the book as a whole, and in completing (in the concluding workbook pages) statements like ``The last thing I did with you was...'' and ``What scares me the most is...''

The month of May, impeccable spring weather, and the goddess Capitalism sitting on her long-�since-�tawdry throne. On the top step outside Hotel Forest hovered a young woman, more a girl than a woman, and more a foreigner&#x2014;�which she also was&#x2014;�than anything else. The hotel looked out over NDK, the former communist regime&#x2019;s palace of culture, a giant concrete blossom now patrolled by teenagers; sunlight falling across the plaza glinted off their spiky heads. Alexandra Boyd, exhausted from an endless plane ride, stood watching the Bulgarian kids on their skateboards and trying to tuck her long straight hair behind one ear. To her right rose apartment buildings of ochre and gray stucco, as well as more recent glass-�and-�steel construction and a billboard that showed a woman in a bikini whose breasts surged out toward a bottle of vodka. Stately trees bloomed near the billboard, white and magenta&#x2014;�horse chestnuts, which Alexandra had seen during a trip to France in college, her only other time on the European continent. Her eyes were gritty, her scalp grimed with the sweat of travel. She needed to eat, shower, sleep&#x2014;�yes, sleep, after the final flight from Amsterdam, that jerking awake every few minutes into self-�exile across an ocean. She glanced down at her feet to make sure they were still there. Except for a pair of bright red sneakers, her clothes were simple&#x2014;�thin blouse, blue jeans, a sweater tied around her waist&#x2014;�so that she felt dowdy next to the tailored skirts and stilettos that made their way past her. On her left wrist, she wore a wide black bracelet; in her ears, spears of obsidian. She gripped the handles of a rolling suitcase and a dark satchel containing a guidebook, a dictionary, extra clothes. Over her shoulder she carried a computer bag and her loose multicolored purse with a notebook and a paperback of Emily Dickinson at the very bottom.<br><br>From her plane window, Alexandra had seen a city cradled in mountains and flanked by towering apartment buildings like tombstones. Stepping off the plane with her new camera in her hand, she&#x2019;d breathed unfamiliar air&#x2014;�coal and diesel and then a gust that smelled of plowed earth. She had walked across the tarmac and onto the airport bus, observed shiny new customs booths and their taciturn officials, the exotic stamp in her passport. Her taxi had looped around the edges of Sofia and into the heart of the city&#x2014;�a longer route than necessary, she now suspected&#x2014;�brushing past outdoor caf� tables and lampposts that bore political placards or signs for sex shops. From the taxi window, she&#x2019;d photographed ancient Fords and Opels, new Audis with tinted gangster windows, large slow buses, and trolleys like clanking Megalosauruses that threw sparks from their iron rails. To her amazement, she&#x2019;d seen that the center of the city was paved with yellow cobblestones.<br><br>But the driver had somehow misunderstood her request and dropped her here, at Hotel Forest, not at the hostel she&#x2019;d booked weeks earlier. Alexandra hadn&#x2019;t understood the situation, either, until he was gone and she had mounted the steps of the hotel to get a closer look. Now she was alone, more thoroughly than she had ever been in her twenty-�six years. In the middle of the city, in the middle of a history about which she had no real idea, among people who went purposefully up and down the steps of the hotel, she stood wondering whether to descend and try to get another taxi. She doubted she could afford the glass and cement monolith that loomed at her back, with its tinted windows, its crow-�like clients in dark suits hustling in and out or smoking on the steps. One thing seemed certain: she was in the wrong place.<br><br>Alexandra might have stood this way long minutes more, but suddenly the doors slid open just behind her and she turned to see three people coming out of the hotel. One of them was a white-�haired man in a wheelchair clutching several travel bags against his suit jacket. A tall middle-�aged man held onto the chair with one hand and a cell phone with the other; he was speaking with someone. Beside him stood their companion, an old woman with one hand on the tall man&#x2019;s elbow and a purse dangling from her wrist, bowlegged beneath her black dress. Her hair was auburn, with streaks of gray that radiated from a painfully bare parting. The middle-�aged man finished his call and hung up. The old lady looked up at him and he bent over to tell her something.<br><br>Alexandra moved aside and watched them struggle across the hotel landing to the top of the steps and felt, as she often did, a stab of compassion for other people&#x2019;s fates. There was no way for them to descend, no ramp or wheelchair access, as there would have been at home. But the dark-�haired tall man appeared to be magically strong; he bent and lifted the older man out of the chair, taking his luggage along. And the woman seemed to come alive inside her empty gaze, long enough to fold the chair with a few practiced motions and carry it slowly down the steps&#x2014;�she, too, was stronger than she looked.<br><br>Alexandra picked up her own satchels and suitcase and followed them, feeling that their sense of purpose might propel her forward. At the bottom of the steps, the tall man put the old man back into the wheelchair. They all rested a moment, Alexandra standing almost next to them at the edge of the taxi lane. She saw that the tall man was dressed in a black vest and an immaculate white shirt, too warm and formal for the day. His trousers were also too shiny, his black shoes too highly polished. His thick dark hair, with its sheen of silver, was brushed firmly back from his forehead. A strong profile. Up close he looked younger than she&#x2019;d first thought him. He was frowning, his face flushed, glance sharp. It was hard for her to tell whether he was nearer to thirty-�eight or fifty-�five. She realized through her fatigue that he might be one of the handsomest men she&#x2019;d ever observed, broad-�shouldered and dignified under his somehow out-�of-�date clothes, his nose long and elegant, the cheekbones flowing up toward narrow bright eyes when he turned slightly in her direction. Fine grooves radiated from the edges of his mouth, as if he had a different face that he reserved for smiling. She saw that he was too old for her after all. His hand hung at his side, only a few feet from one of hers. She felt an actual twinge of desire, and took a step away.<br><br>Now the tall man went over to the window of the nearest taxi and plunged into some sort of negotiation; the taxi driver&#x2019;s voice rose in protest; Alexandra wondered if she might learn something from all this. While she was watching, she had a moment of vertigo, so that the traffic receded to an uncomfortable buzz in her ears and then returned louder&#x2014;�jet lag. The tall man could not seem to come to an agreement with the driver, even when the old woman leaned in and added indignant words of her own. The driver waved a dismissive hand and rolled up his window.<br><br>The tall man picked up their luggage again, three or four nylon and canvas bags, and stepped to another taxi, even nearer to where Alexandra stood. She resolved not to try the first driver herself. Then the tall man abruptly concluded his bargaining and opened the back door of this acceptable new cab. He set their luggage down on the sidewalk and helped the crooked figure out of the wheelchair and into the back seat.<br><br>Alexandra wouldn&#x2019;t have moved toward them again if the old woman hadn&#x2019;t suddenly stumbled, trying to get into the taxi beside the old man. Alexandra reached out and caught the woman&#x2019;s upper arm in a firm sudden grip she hadn&#x2019;t known herself capable of. Through the black fabric of the sleeve, she could feel a bone, surprisingly light and warm. The woman turned to stare at her, then righted herself and said something in Bulgarian, and the tall man looked fully around at Alexandra for the first time. Maybe he wasn&#x2019;t really handsome, she thought; it was just that his eyes were remarkable&#x2014;�larger than they&#x2019;d seemed from the side, the irises amber when the sunlight touched them. He and the old lady both smiled at her; he helped his mother carefully into the seat of the taxi, reaching back with his other hand for their bags. It was as if he knew Alexandra would come to their rescue again. And she did, catching the smaller bags up in a tangle and passing them to him. He seemed to be in a hurry now. She kept a grip on her own heavy satchel and laptop, and especially on her purse, just in case.<br><br>He straightened up and glanced down at the bags she had handed to him. Then he looked at her again.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you very much,&#x201d; he said to her in heavily accented English&#x2014;�was it so obvious that she was a foreigner?<br><br>&#x201c;Can I help you?&#x201d; she asked, and felt foolish.<br><br>&#x201c;You already helped me,&#x201d; he said. Now his face was sad, the momentary smile gone. &#x201c;Are you in Bulgaria for a vacation?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;To teach. Are you visiting Sofia from somewhere else?&#x201d; After she said this, she realized it might not sound complimentary. It was true that he and his elderly parents did not look cosmopolitan in this setting. But he was the first person she had really spoken to in almost two days, and she didn&#x2019;t want to stop, although the old man and the old woman were waiting for him in the cab.<br><br>He shook his head. She had read in her guidebook that Bulgarians traditionally nodded to mean &#x201c;no&#x201d; and shook their heads to mean &#x201c;yes,&#x201d; but that not everyone did this anymore. She wondered which category the tall man fell into.<br><br>&#x201c;Our plan&#x2014;�it was to go to Velin Monastery,&#x201d; he said. He glanced behind him, as if expecting to see someone else. &#x201c;It is very pretty and famous. You must visit it.&#x201d;<br><br>She liked his voice. &#x201c;Yes, I&#x2019;ll try to do that,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>He did smile then&#x2014;�slightly, without activating all the grooves. He smelled of soap, and of clean wool. He started to turn away, but paused. &#x201c;Do you like Bulgaria? People say that it is the place where anything will happen. Can happen,&#x201d; he corrected himself.<br><br>Alexandra hadn&#x2019;t been even in Sofia long enough to know what she thought of the country.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s beautiful,&#x201d; she said finally, and saying this reminded her of the mountains she had seen as she flew in. &#x201c;Really beautiful,&#x201d; she added with more conviction.<br><br>He inclined his head to one side, seemed to bow a little&#x2014;�polite people, Bulgarians&#x2014;�and turned toward the cab.<br><br>&#x201c;May I take your picture?&#x201d; she said quickly. &#x201c;Would you mind? You&#x2019;re the first people I&#x2019;ve talked with here.&#x201d; She wanted a photograph of him&#x2014;�the most interesting face she&#x2019;d ever seen, and now would never see again.<br><br>The tall man bent obligingly close to the open cab door, although he looked anxious. She had the impression that he was in a hurry. But the old woman leaned out toward Alexandra with a smile of her own: dentures, too white and regular. The old man did not turn; he sat gazing ahead in the back seat of the taxi. Alexandra pulled her camera out of her purse and took a swift shot. She wondered if she should offer to send the picture to them, later, but she wasn&#x2019;t sure that elderly people in this country&#x2014;�or a formal-�looking middle-�aged man&#x2014;�passed photos around on email, especially with strangers.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Mersi.&#x201d; That was the simple Bulgarian version of thanks; she couldn&#x2019;t bring herself to attempt the longer, infinitely harder word she&#x2019;d tried to memorize. The tall man stared at her for a moment, and she thought his face was even sadder. He raised a hand to her and shut his old people quickly into the cab. Then he swung down into the front seat beside the driver. Their conversation had taken only a couple of minutes, but a taxi somewhere along the line had lost patience and was honking. The driver of the little family took off with a rush of tires and moved into the river of traffic, vanishing at once.</p><h2>Knock Knock: My Dad&#39;s Dream for Me (Coretta Scott King Illustrator Award Winner)</h2><p><i>Every morning, I play a game with my father.</i><i>He goes knock knock </i><i>on my door</i><i>and I pretend to be asleep</i><i>till he gets right next to the bed.</i><i>And my papa, he tells me, "I love you."</i><i><br></i>But what happens when, one day, that "knock knock" doesn't come?

Divorced without children, life isn&#x2019;t what she had pictured for herself twenty years ago. Not up to admitting any of this in front of friends and family, she bails on the surprise party being thrown for her and books a last-minute trip to Barbados for a stay at the luxurious hotel where she&#x2019;d spent her honeymoon ten years before. Is she going back to mourn the marriage she&#x2019;d thought would last forever? Or in an attempt to chase out of her heart for good a betrayal that forever changed her?Anders Walker might be just the ticket for that. After a brief career on Wall Street and a life experience that turned his world upside down, Anders took off the golden handcuffs and walked away for good. When he spots Catherine checking in on arrival at the hotel, he challenges her to try his spin class. He sees a woman who no longer considers herself someone a guy like him would be attracted to. Except that she&#x2019;s wrong. In Catherine, he recognizes a woman who defines herself by rejection. He sees, too, that she has made work her life.

I quickly fell in love with Kind of Blue and of course we at IU started experimenting with modal tunes and trying to keep our place in those many 8 bar phrases that seemed at times to make me feel like I was in the middle of a desert and couldnt see for the life of me the beginning of the next 8 bar phrase. When I began teaching privately for the first time in Seymour, Indiana I had a girl flute student who really had a great sound. One day I asked her to improvise on a D- dorian scale and off she went. I could tell she was playing what she heard in her mind and I was so surprised. It really sounded natural. So, I asked other students to play on a dorian scale and they did fine. Thats how I got started teaching improv. I think others at the time were using the blues as a vehicle but the students I was working with knew nothing about the blues but they could keep their place in the 4 and 8 bar phrases so I went ahead later and used that modal approach on my Volume 1 play-a-long ... and the rest is history.</p></p><p></p><h2>Favorite Recipes from Melissa Clark&#39;s Kitchen: Family Meals, Festive Gatherings, and Everything In-between</h2><p><b>Beloved <i>New York Times</i> food columnist Melissa Clark selects more than 100 of her all-time favorite recipes and gathers them here in this collection of delicious, reliable, palate-pleasing dishes for every occasion.

Curlew, keeper of the sky world, guarded fire and kept it from the earth. Coyote, however, devised a clever plan to steal fire, aided by Grizzly Bear, Wren, Snake, Frog, Eagle, and Beaver. These brave and resourceful animal beings raided the land above and risked all to steal fire from Curlew.&nbsp;<i>Beaver Steals Fire</i> is an ancient and powerful tale springing from the hearts and experiences of the Salish people of Montana. Steeped in the rich and culturally vital storytelling tradition of the tribe, this tale teaches both respect for fire and awareness of its significance, themes particularly relevant today. This unforgettable version of the story is told by Salish elder Johnny Arlee and beautifully illustrated by tribal artist Sam Sandoval.</p><p><b>A story beautifully told</b>&nbsp;<i>Beaver Steals Fire: A Salish Coyote Story</i>, illustrated by Sam Sandoval, University of Nebraska Press, hardbound, $14.95 At first glance, <i>Beaver Steals Fire</i> seems to be a children&#x2019;s book. Indeed, the lively illustrations by Sam Sandoval would appeal to most young readers. &nbsp;Mr. Sandoval draws well and has created animal characters with personality, no mean feat when you&#x2019;re trying to give human expression to a bird. I would have preferred a bigger palette. Too many shades of brown and yellow for my taste. And, are Western Montana frogs brown? &nbsp;The words of John Arlee, the author, have the pleasant rhythm and subtle repetition of all good storytellers. I could close my eyes and see a family cuddled up to keep warm on a dark winter&#x2019;s night, listening to a favorite tale. &#x201c;Grandpa, tell us about ... .&#x201d; &nbsp;This book retells the Salish version of the gift of fire. As in many other fire myths, fire comes from the sky, and fire is so valuable that it must be stolen. Coyote is voted in to brainstorm the expedition, but Beaver is the real hero. To reach the heavenly fire, the animals fasten a rope to the top of the sky and climb. &#x201c;Grizzly Bear climbed last. Because he was such a greedy person, he carried his lunch with him.&#x201d; &nbsp;Evidently, lunch for a grizzly was no small thing. The rope broke and Grizzly Bear fell back to earth. Fun, I thought. Kids will like this. I liked it, and I&#x2019;m only an honorary kid.&nbsp;But also included in this picture book is information on ancient Salish and Kootenai fire management. Before the white man, the tribe had a fire setter, evidently an honored and important person, who started controlled fires. This human intervention resulted in healthy forests and fields. Wildfires also burned without interference. &nbsp;Another important cultural tidbit: This Coyote story and others like it should only be told in the dark of winter when the snow is on the ground. After early March, snakes will come get you, or it will snow in summer! &nbsp;I doubt that anyone really believed that, but it was good for a delicious shiver. Winter is a season of deserved rest. With the coming of spring, it&#x2019;s back to work. &nbsp;<i>Beaver Steals Fire</i> is a gift for the whole family, beautifully produced, and very affordable at $14.99. Thanks to the University of Nebraska Press and the Salish and Pend d&#x2019;Oreille Culture Committee.&nbsp; (Sharie Clawson <i>Billings Gazette (MT)</i> 2005-12-19)<br><br><b>Beaver Steals Fire</b>.

The animals on earth had no fire." It is very cold, and to keep warm, the Earth animals form a fire-raiding party and appoint Coyote as leader. The animals follow Coyote's instructions, and steal fire from the sky world, bringing it to Earth and passing it from camp to camp. Handsomely illustrated by Salish tribal artist Sandoval, this accessible story credited to confederated Salish and Kootenai tribes, incorporates Salish words and is part of a larger fire-education project that focuses on native use of fire as well as principles of fire ecology. A note asks readers to respect the tradition that this story be told or discussed only during winter, when snow is on the ground.

Retold by Salish elder Johnny Arlee, and wonderfully illustrated in full color by tribal artist Sam Sandoval, <i>Beaver Steals Fire</i> recounts how the animals worked together to obtain fire and help prepare the world for inhabitation by human beings. Beaver Steals Fire is presented with the full support of The Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribal Division of Fire; a note to the reader at the beginning asks those who use <i>Beaver Steals Fire</i> in the classroom or others who read it aloud to orally tell or discuss the story only in winter, when snow is on the ground, as this is a strongly ingrained part of tribal seasonal tradition. A beautifully presented legend, highly recommended. (<i>Children's Bookwatch</i> 2006-02-20)<br><br><b>BEAVER STEALS FIRE: A Salish Coyote Story</b>, by the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2005), 64 pp., $14.95 pb.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Beaver Steals Fire</i> is a beautifully illustrated retelling of a story of the Montana Salish People. Johnny Arlee, the storyteller, is a Salish Elder, and worked with illustrator Sam Sandoval to create a book suitable for both younger children and those wishing to learn more about Salish and Pend d'Oreille culture. <i>Beaver Steals Fire</i> describes how Coyote leads a team of animals to steal fire from the denizens of the sky world and bring it to the chilly residents of the Earth below. The introduction to the book asks those who would read it aloud to confine such readings to the winter months, which is when the story was traditionally told.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The story is suitable for young children, though older children will get more out of the discussion of the traditional use of fire by the Salish that follows the story. Arlee challenges the claim that North America was a "virgin landscape" before the coming of European immigrants, arguing from both tradition and archaeological evidence that the Salish (among many others) heavily modified the land with fire to expand the prairie and promote certain plant species. This forces readers to confront difficult questions about the nature of conservation, since Arlee argues for a return to the fire-managed landscape of his people rather than the relatively unmanaged ecosystem of today. Overall, <i>Beaver Steals Fire </i>makes both a fine children's tale and an interesting way to introduce students to the complexities of the relationship of Indian Peoples to the land.

Like many Native stories, it can only be told in the cold winter months when snow is on the ground. The story shows how the animals helped prepare the world for human beings. It also touches on the ideas of teamwork, greed and deception. &#x201c;Beaver Steals Fire,&#x201d; is our November Book of the Month.&nbsp;Native America Calling airs live Monday-Friday&nbsp;1pm EST, 10am PST.

"A long, long time ago, the only animals who had fire lived in the land above, up in the sky. The animals on earth had no fire." It is very cold, and to keep warm, the Earth animals form a fire-raiding party and appoint Coyote as leader. The animals follow Coyote's instructions, and steal fire from the sky world, bringing it to Earth and passing it from camp to camp. Handsomely illustrated by Salish tribal artist Sandoval, this accessible story credited to confederated Salish and Kootenai tribes, incorporates Salish words and is part of a larger fire-education project that focuses on native use of fire as well as principles of fire ecology. A note asks readers to respect the tradition that this story be told or discussed only during winter, when snow is on the ground. A brief guide to written Salish and the International Phonetic Alphabet is appended. <i>Karen Hutt</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

But no theater of operations offered more fatal choices than the skies above Nazi-occupied Europe. Inside of a B-17 Bomber, thousands of feet above the earth, death was always a moment away. From the hellish storms of enemy flak and relentless strafing of Luftwaffe fighters, to mid-air collisions, mechanical failure, and simple bad luck, it&#x2019;s a wonder any man would volunteer for such dangerous duty. But some very brave men did.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> Some paid the ultimate price. Some made it home. But in the end, all would achieve victory.<br> &nbsp;<br> Here, author Travis L.

A Cruising Adventure of America&#39;s Great Loop</h2><p>This is the story of a couple&#39;s travels on a forty-foot trawler cruising 6300 miles and 145 locks around the eastern part of North America known as America&#39;s Great Loop or the Great Circle Cruise. Their nautical ineptitude is evident from the beginning, but pulling from their personal and collective strengths, the authors overcome doubt, a lack of experience, and real and imagined horrors. The odyssey is told the way life hands out its adventures -- sometimes humorously, sometimes tragically, but always memorably. The writing is light and appealing, but there is a serious strain running through the book for those who relish history and descriptions of the landscape. Astute and attentive to detail, they chronicled events and kept an account of expenses, equipment and charting. As a result, the appendix/guidebook is worth the price of the book for anyone interested in planning their cruise. Topics include necessary charts and guidebooks, information on locks, setting an itinerary, resource addresses and websites, details on equipment and the best place to be educated about boating. The book has full-color inserts with black and white photographs interspersed throughout.</p><p>"Honey, Let's Get a Boat..." won first place in the Travel Book category in the 1999 North American Travel Journalists Association Awards Competition. <p>It is hard to find a group of cruising skippers today that doesn't include someone who has just completed, is planning to make, or knows a person who has just made the Great Loop trip. (From Waterway Guide-Great Lakes 1994 Edition article featuring Walter Cronkite) </p><p>And there's hardly an issue of a magazine that doesn't include travel adventures of someone cruising America along the water's edge. Every year hundreds of boaters complete the Great Loop Cruise while thousands more dream of doing it in their lifetime. Many wait until retirement, while others bail out at an earlier age to embark on a lifestyle where lawnmowers don't exist and the sun always sets over sparkling water. </p><p>Honey, Let's Get a Boat... is for the hopeless romantic as well as the serious boater eager to learn about America's Great Loop (or Great Circle) trip. Honey.... also appeals to the suburban banker and the corporate executive eager to leave their jobs for adventure aboard boats.</p>Eager for a change and deaf to the admonitions of their children, the authors purchase a forty-foot boat. They catch the excitement of visiting sea ports, the fear of plowing huge bodies of water, the thrill of moving through 145 locks, and the delight of wandering down the inland rivers. <p>Honey, Let's Get a Boat... is the story of a couple who encounter each other and a quirky boat as they discover America from the water's edge. </p><p>Whether you are a hopeless romantic, vicarious traveler or serious boater, you will find this book both instructive and entertaining. Cruise with the Stob's as they complete the 6300-mile trip around America's Great Loop. </p><p>If someone in your life says to you, Honey, Let's Get a Boat... and you don't know anything about boating, flip to the last section of this book.

Instructions clarify the making of a basic family tree and pedigree chart; important rules of research method and etiquette teach the beginner good genealogical technique. In addition there are pages on autographs, family tales, heraldry, geography, foreign languages, ethnic crafts, foods and customs, a sample notebook filing system, correspondence record, glossary, bibliography, ideas on further study and projects.

Eugenia Zukerman&#x2019;s poetry and simple prose, both heartbreaking and ultimately inspirational, ushers the reader into her world as she unflinchingly examines familial loyalties, moments from her past and present, and the need to face an uncertain future due to the diagnosis of a condition that she truly hopes &#x201c;will remain unnamed.&#x201d;<br><br> Flutist, writer, artistic director of major music series, television journalist, educator and internet entrepreneur, Zukerman addresses her &#x201c;lapses and losses&#x201d; as she confronts and deals with a future under the shadow of her Alzheimer&#x2019;s diagnosis.<br><br> Touching, honest, and fearlessly heartfelt, Like Falling Through a Cloud recounts Zukerman&#x2019;s discovery, consultations, and diagnosis, all while navigating the death of her 103-year-old mother, a performance at the Kennedy Center, and the consolidation of her life via a full-time move to upstate New York. As she finds strength in family love, self-examination, and the enduring power of creating music, Zukerman teaches us the importance of living in the now, while accepting that what comes next may remain a mystery.</p><p>Hailed by the press as &#x201c;one of the finest flutists of our time,&#x201d; <b>Eugenia Zukerman</b> is an internationally renowned recitalist and soloist who enjoys her busy schedule as a performer, writer, artistic&nbsp;director, and educator. She was the Artistic Director of the Bravo! Vail Valley&nbsp;Music Festival in Vail, Colorado for thirteen&nbsp;years&nbsp;and the Arts Correspondent on CBS&nbsp;Sunday Morning for more than twenty-five&nbsp;years. Her list of writing credits includes four&nbsp;books and multiple screenplays, articles, and book reviews. A Massachusetts native, Zukerman makes her home in upstate New York with her husband, two horses,&nbsp;three dogs, and assorted wildlife.&#x201c;In <i>Like Falling Through a Cloud</i>, Eugenia Zuckerman gives her reader privileged access to her inner life, as she begins to understand and live with a recent medical diagnosis. As she describes the vast changes in her different states of mind in a series of poetic snapshots, her artistic aura shines through with lightness, courage, and humor. In expressing the borders between fear, doubt, vulnerability, and love, she reminds us of the delicate balance between human fragility and resilience, and how the role of poetry and music offers a balm when we are faced with psychic turbulence." <b>&#x2014; Yo-Yo Ma, Cellist</b><br> &nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Bravery and inspiration come in many forms. In the face of dealing with her own challenges, Eugenia Zukerman has written a beautiful personal narrative that inspires bravery in the face of serious life changes.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014; Jaap van Zweden</b>, New York Philharmonic Music Director<br><br><p>&#x201c;Eugenia Zukerman has taken an experience and event that can be traumatic and brought light to it. Her poetic style of communicating the nature of her world in the face of this challenge is endearing. I believe anybody who is themselves or is having any family member experience some decline in memory will feel uplifted and informed by this highly special and unique work.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014; Herbert Pardes, M.D.</b>, Executive Vice Chairman of the Board of Trustees of New York-Presbyterian Hospital</p><br><br><p>"Eugenia Zukerman&#x2019;s new book, <i>Like Falling Through a Cloud</i>, is a masterpiece of inspiration, poetry, reflection, memories, and the heartbreak of discovering that one is having the early signs of dementia. Writing in the present tense, of past reflection, of moments of sheer delight&#x2014;as well as moments of sheer horror&#x2014;Eugenia has authored a must-read. I was going to say a must-read for those who suffer from moments of forgetfulness, but instead, I&#x2019;m going to say it&#x2019;s a book for everyone. It transcends the particulars, becoming applicable to any situation you might find yourself in. That is the sign of a truly inspiring volume, a classic, and <i>Like Falling Through a Clou</i>d is a classic&#x2014;for everyone.&nbsp; The beautiful message that Ms. Zukerman has created in the astonishing, revealing, and inspiring book is that we all have life to live, dreams to dream, and human kindness to both give and receive. The author has always been an extraordinary talent, both musically and linguistically. In <i>Like Falling Through a Cloud</i>, she has written the unforgettable." &#x2014;<b>&nbsp;Judy Collins</b>, American Singer and Songwriter</p><br><br>"Eugenia Zukerman bravely shares her personal journey and self-awareness as she battles with Alzheimer&#x2019;s and the anxiety that comes with it. She inspires with her strength and willingness to find joy and beauty in small and big things in life. Through music, love, family and peace of nature, you feel her determination to appreciate every day and the will to move forward. She beautifully translates her frightening and inspiring experiences into poetry for the reader." &#x2014;&nbsp;<b>Yefin Bronfman</b>, pianist<br><br>"The most interesting writers of our time are creating hybrid literature that combines poetry, fiction, and autobiography. As we proceed in life, our way of perceiving the world changes, and few writers have the courage to depict this. Eugenia Zukerman&#x2014;perhaps because she is a musician and a writer&#x2014;has chronicled the music of the brain in an extraordinary way. <i>Like Falling Through a Cloud</i> is beautiful and riveting." &#x2014;&nbsp;<b>Erica Jong</b>, author of <i>FEAR OF FLYING</i><br> &nbsp;<br><br><p>&#x201c;My sister,&nbsp;Eugenia&nbsp;(Genie to me), admirably always embraces the moment for&nbsp;whatever it brings. After recently receiving the diagnosis of cognitive decline, she was stunned but then took stock of how she felt and what it all means. A generous result is her beguiling prose poem, <i>Like Falling through a Cloud</i>, in which she faces the mysteries of memory, and self-discovery through change. In this short, yet revealing, sometimes funny, sometimes sad volume, she shares her experience and&nbsp;her candid self-perceptions. This compact volume has helped me as Genie&#x2019;s big sister (and a physician) understand what is going on far better than my empiric medical knowledge.&nbsp;This gem of a book should provide solace and insight for family and friends struggling to understand the complex issues of cognitive decline. More than that, it is a tale of bravery, strength, and healing.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014; Julie R. Ingelfinger, M.D.</b>, Professor of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, and Senior Consultant in Pediatric Nephrology at Massachusetts General Hospital for Children at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston</p><br><br><p>"Heart-crushing poetry, eloquent typography, and stunning candor combine to make Eugenia Zukerman&#x2019;s voyage into the uncharted landscape of memory loss the most compelling book you will read this year. A brave journey beautifully told." &#x2014;<b>&nbsp;Letty Cottin Pogrebin</b>, founding editor of <i>MS. Magazine</i></p><br><br>"I have known and loved Eugenia Zukerman my whole adult life. Of course, it was easy to fall for&nbsp;such a ravishing beauty, devastatingly diaphanous Diana that she is, but once hooked, more arrows felled me: a&nbsp;brilliant musician, to be sure, but also a brilliant and panoramically empowered mind and spirit, a captivating and pioneering tele-journalist and media advocate for the arts, an inspired and masterful writer, endlessly quick-witted and always an&nbsp;impassioned and aware citizen of the world. It should come as no&nbsp;surprise, then, that when she&nbsp;discerned early signs of a potential and ever-unnamed usurper of mental acuity, her response would be to make us all traverse this frightening stage of her life by imbuing tragedy with transcendence in her memoir, <i>Like Falling Through A Cloud</i>. Eugenia&#x2019;s choice of telling this chilling tale of tenuous tendrils of cognition as aphorisms as light, fleeting and fleeing as dandelion seeds is a true masterstroke. She paints the pages in serendipitous typographical free-verse, with the ease and urbanity of an Ogden Nash, with the nostalgia and romance of Nabokov, and ever with an endearing charm and more than occasional epiphany all her own. Never has a book made me want to laugh and cry in equal and empathetic measure." &#x2014;&nbsp;<b>Christopher O'Riley</b>, pianist and host of NPR's FROM THE TOP<br> &nbsp;<br><br>"In her moving debut memoir, Zukerman, a flutist and former arts correspondent for CBS Sunday Morning, tells of her diagnosis of Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease. Writing in a mix of verse and prose, she begins with a poem as she realizes her memory is becoming increasing faulty (&#x201c;Sometimes/when I wake up/it&#x2019;s dark/where am I?&#x201d;), then tells of meeting with her neurologist, who also diagnoses her with anxiety. Subsequent chapters examine therapist visits, ruminations about drug and clinical trials, and her mother&#x2019;s death at 103. Zukerman, now in her 70s, writes of how her memory loss has affected her life with her husband, and their eventual move to upstate New York, where the disease progresses (&#x201c;So this is how it begins/ The caretaking,/ the endless helping my once independent wife,&#x201d; she believes her husband must be thinking). &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a shiner where my brain used to be&#x2014;it&#x2019;s become more and more troubling to me,&#x201d; she says plaintively, easily eliciting empathy from readers. While the unorthodox narrative structure can distract at times, it doesn&#x2019;t detract from the work&#x2019;s power. Zukerman&#x2019;s unflinching memoir in verse will most appeal to those dealing with this common yet complex illness."&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><h2>George Washington&#39;s Farewell Address (Books of American Wisdom)</h2><p>On September 17,1796, George Washington announced that he would leave the presidency.

As a young man, he learned the morals, manners, and knowledge necessary to become a Virginia gentleman. He was particularly interested in the military arts and western expansion. At the age of 16, he helped survey Shenandoah lands. At the age of 22, he was commissioned a lieutenant colonel and fought in the first battles of what became the French and Indian War.

Ministers devote themselves to caring for their congregations, often at the expense of caring for themselves. Studies consistently show that physical health among clergy is significantly worse than among adults who are not in ministry. Flourishing in Ministry offers clergy and those who support them practical advice for not just surviving this grueling profession, but thriving in it.<br><br>Matt Bloom, director of the Flourishing in Ministry project, shares groundbreaking research from more than a decade of study. Flourishing in Ministry project draws on more than five thousand surveys and three hundred in-depth interviews with clergy across denominations, ages, races, genders, and years of practice in ministry. It distills this deep research into easily understandable stages of flourishing that can be practiced at any stage in ministry or ministry formation.</p><p><p>Matt Bloom is the principal investigator on the Flourishing in Ministry project (funded by the Lilly Endowment, Inc.) and the Faith and Flourishing at Work project (funded by Templetone Religion Trust). He is associate professor at the University of Notre Dame and director of the Wellbeing at Work project. Matt has studied and published academic and practitioner articles on wellbeing at work for more than twenty-five years.</p>A genuine treasure trove of wisdom on what promotes flourishing in ministry and what derails it. Informed by a rich set of data&#x2014;surveys and interviews with ten-thousand pastors from diverse settings&#x2014;this book not only captures key factors behind thriving, it offers concrete means to sustain wellness. This invaluable guide and the bigger project from which it grows are destined to transform how we think about the lives and wellbeing of congregational pastors.<br><br> (Bonnie J. Miller-McLemore, Vanderbilt University Divinity School)<br><br>Pastors, denominational leaders, people in congregations, and seminary faculty and administrators will benefit greatly from Bloom&#x2019;s astute analysis of clergy well-being. Bloom draws on his research with pastors and the extensive scientific research on well-being to give us a comprehensive way of understanding what is integral to pastoral flourishing for the sake of the church and the world. (Kathleen A. Cahalan, Saint John&#x2019;s University School of Theology and Seminary)<br><br>I believe there are few professions or vocations that face as steep a challenge as the pastor&#x2019;s. The accelerating cultural changes and weakening of the institutions of religion make it a very difficult time to be a pastor. Matt Bloom has done us all an important favor. He provids an empirical examination of these struggles and highlights the cultural and institutional transitions, but even more, he takes us into the existential sense that a pastor feels about her or his vocation. This highly readable, intricately researched, and timely book is a must-read for anyone who forms, or cares about the formation of, clergy. <br><br> (Andrew Root, Luther Seminary)<br><br>Matt Bloom is a rare hybrid. As an astute scientist with decades of experience, he knows his way well through the sociological studies and the psychological research on leadership and professional and personal wellbeing. But as a person of deep empathy and sensitive listening, he also knows the profundity of ministerial life. He understands the mystery of holy calling, the often paradoxical nature of discernment of God&#x2019;s will, and the long and complex journey of growth in grace. Consequently this book is a remarkable and significant contribution, a multi-layered conversation among many disciplines and voices, and an important resource for pastors and those who care about their flourishing. No one could have done this better than Matt Bloom. (Thomas G. Long, Bandy Professor Emeritus of Preaching, Candler School of Theology at Emory University)</p><h2>Admiral Richard E. Byrd&#39;s Missing Diary: A Flight To The Land Beyond The North Pole Into The Hollow Earth</h2><p>In the winter of 1947, Admiral Richard E. Byrd allegedly flew a secret mission across the frozen waters of the arctic. There, he claimed to have seen a previously unknown land with forests and even prehistoric animals. Even more incredible, he encountered flying discs from a technologically advanced civilization hidden deep within the hollow Earth. <p> This incredible adventure is revealed in Byrd's diary which had been missing for many years. Had it been sealed away by the U.S. government in fear of the haunting message given to Byrd by the inhabitants of the hollow Earth? Or is the truth even more shocking? </p><p> We now know that at the time referenced in Byrd's missing diary, he had actually been part of the Navy mission to Antarctica called Operation Highjump.

In addition, Christian theologians have long described beauty as a third inseparable reality which together with goodness and truth, paint a full picture of who God is.&nbsp;<br>Alabaster aims to give the reader a fresh visual experience and heightened level of contemplation while reading this ancient text, that ultimately points to the beauty of God.<b><br>Why Alabaster?</b><br><ul><li><b>Thoughtful Design:&nbsp;</b>Design matters.

It was theologian Hans Urs Von Balthassar who once wrote that without beauty, goodness looses its attractiveness and truth loses its cogency. We live in a visual culture. Anyone can make an image and we are shaped by what we see. We value bringing this visual reality to a faith-based context. We believe in the divine inspiration, trustworthiness and authority of the Bible--and we bring this into everything we make and do.Kalos is the word for beauty in the original Greek; it literally means beautiful as a sign of inward goodness. This means beauty isn&#39;t just an aesthetic--it&#39;s a way of going through the world. To live beautifully is to live a life that contributes to human flourishing--in our work, in our relationships, in our communities.Alabaster Co. began late one night when friends Bryan Chung and Brian Chung were deep in discussion on creativity and God. Reflecting on the direction culture was taking toward visual images, innovation and design, an idea was born: create a brand passionate about fully exploring the intersection of creativity, beauty, and faith. Realizing that beauty is a foundational value when talking about creativity and God, they decided to name the company Alabaster, after one of the only times Jesus uses the word beautiful in the Gospels. In Mark 14:1-9, a woman breaks an alabaster jar of incredibly expensive perfume onto Jesus&#39; head. Many people in the room scoff at her and say what she has done is a complete waste. But Jesus defends the woman saying, &#34;leave her alone, why do you bother her? What she has done is a beautiful thing.&#34; It is this complete act of sacrificial giving which Jesus calls - in the original greek - kalos, which literally means beautiful as a sign of inward goodness. We wanted to have this same level of intentionality and thoughtfulness as the woman did as we created Alabaster. Alabaster was officially launched on Kickstarter in October 2016 with its first project: Alabaster: The Bible Beautiful. After a successful launch, the books were printed and a conversation began. Since then, we&#39;ve put the books on Amazon, made new projects and are planning for the future, all with the same passion: explore the intersection of creativity, beauty, and faith for the sake of a more beautiful human flourishing.</p><h2>Doodle Stitching Transfer Pack</h2><p>Embroiderers love Aimee Ray's "Doodling" collections&#x2014;and this one-stop resource contains 300 of her most popular motifs, including nearly 30 entirely new designs.

Jane speaks about being an author at schools and conferences&#x2014;in all but eleven of the United States, so far, and such places as Uganda, Nigeria, Kenya, France, Germany, Romania, England, Indonesia, Cambodia, the Philippines, and Japan. She helped start Ethiopia Reads (EthiopiaReads.org), a nonprofit that is planting the first libraries for children in Ethiopia. She is the author of many books for children.<br><br>Allison Black&nbsp;is an illustrator and designer specializing in cute and colorful creations. Originally from upstate New York, Allison received her BFA at Syracuse University, and has since lived in Los Angeles, Minneapolis, and now Columbus, Ohio. Over the years, she has developed products ranging from baby bedding and toddler clothes to Christmas ornaments and Easter baskets. But no matter what she&#x2019;s creating, she always brings a little Allison flair to the product through her illustration style, thoughtful design, and fanciful critters.There&#x2019;s quite a lot here to digest. In a mix of rhymed general statements and, in smaller type, pithy prose explanations, Kurtz drops nuggets of information about what poop is, how the excrement of a dozen types of zoo animals differs in shape and composition, what said animals do with their poop in nature, and the many ways zoos (and gardeners) study and recycle all those tons of &#x201c;zoo-doo.&#x201d; She closes with the provocative observation that more intelligent and socialized primates tend to fling their poop with more accuracy than their duller cohorts&#x2014;as, perhaps, &#x201c;a form of communication and self-expression.&#x201d; Reflecting what young readers will be doing by this point, Black illustrates the author&#x2019;s final sally with a troop of heartily laughing monkeys. In fact, all the creatures in these brightly colored cartoon illustrations, even the earthworms, are smiling. So are most of the notably diverse cast of human workers (a few pooper-scoopers look understandably beleaguered), as befits both the topic and the tone of this fresh scoop on poop. &#x2014; John Peters Author: Booklist Source: April 15, 2018<br><br>Any kid who&#x2019;s been to a zoo knows that animal hygiene is not up to Mom&#x2019;s standards. What might come as news are the very good reasons animals may have to leave their droppings where they drop, and the very good uses to which scat can be put. Rhymed verse rolls continuously along the top of spreads in oversized font, offering an introductory outline for the youngest listeners: &#x201c;Sloths creep down from trees to poop, but only once a week./ A penguin shoots its poo out in a fishy-smelling streak.&#x201d; A sentence or two in slightly smaller sans serif type adds nuance to the simple observations. And what about disposal? Kurtz&#x2019;s explanations are largely satisfactory: some poo is trucked to landfills, some ends up in labs for study, some turns into compost (worms love to eat and re-poop the stuff), and some, like fiber-rich elephant poop, even appears later in the zoo gift shop as writing paper and greeting cards. Black&#x2019;s toylike animals, with anthropomorphized grins, will hold more appeal for younger listeners, but the information will delight older, independent readers. What kid wouldn&#x2019;t enjoy imagining a place where nobody tells you to flush, put down the seat, and wash your hands?&nbsp; Author: BCCB Source: May 2018<br><br>Kurtz (<i>Planet Jupiter</i>) playfully delves into the diversity of dung found at the zoo in her latest picture book. &#x201c;A wombat&#x2019;s poo is cube-shaped, so it isn&#x2019;t very roly. / Some snakes poop only once a year. They digest their food sloooow-ly.&#x201d; Simple rhyming couplets deliver the facts, with accompanying sentences providing additional detail (e.g., &#x201c;Wombats are highly territorial. They each deposit 80&#x2013;100 droppings every evening as a signpost to say &#x2018;I&#x2019;m here.&#x2019; &#x201d;). The first half of the book discusses how various creatures take care of back-end business, while the second describes how zoos manage all that manure (much of it is trucked to landfills, while some is composted into &#x201c;Zoo Doo,&#x201d; among other things). The brightly colored, cartoon-style illustrations by Black (<i>Barnyard Boogie!</i>) add levity, as hippos grin, sloths smile, and bats beam. Poop of various sizes is buried, sniffed, squirted, weighed, and even thrown. Young readers going through a bathroom-humor stage should enjoy the topic and the book&#x2019;s light tone but, whether appreciative, awed, or grossed out, all will come away informed.&nbsp; Author: Publishers Weekly Source: April 23, 2018<br><br>Countless zoo books line the shelves, but how often does one discuss animal manure&#x2014;and how a zoo discards it? Employing the page turn to great effect from the very start, Kurtz is bound to get youngsters' attention: "At zoo after zoo / the animals chew. / And then ... // they poo!" Quick rhymes in boldface type across the top make simple statements about each animal's toilet habits. "Sloths creep down from trees to poop, / but only once a week. / A penguin shoots its poo out / in a fishy-smelling streak." Smaller text below offers more in-depth facts: "Why do sloths spend so much energy leaving the protection of trees to poop on the ground? It's a mystery scientists are trying to solve." Black's wide-eyed, expressive animals have personality, but they never cross over to cartoony garishness. After exploring 12 different zoo dwellers, Kurtz then turns her focus to the large amount of poo that accumulates at a zoo every day. What do they do with it? Much is trucked to landfills, but zoos also study it in labs to help understand their animals better. Plus, there are compost options and even elephant-poo paper!....A scatological success.

Yet most of our lives is unwitnessed. We spend our days working, driving, parenting. We sometimes spend whole seasons feeling unnoticed and unappreciated. So how do we find contentment when we feel so hidden?</p><p>In <em>Unseen</em>, Sara Hagerty suggests that this is exactly what God intended. He is the only One who truly knows us. He is the only One who understands the value of the unseen in our lives. When this truth seeps into our souls, we realize that only when we hide ourselves in God can we give ourselves to others in true freedom&#x2014;and know the joy of a deeper relationship with the God who sees us.</p><p>Our culture applauds what we can produce, what we can show, what we can upload to social media. Only when we give all of ourselves to God&#x2014;unedited, abandoned, apparently wasteful in its lack of productivity&#x2014;can we live out who God created us to be. As Hagerty writes, &#x201c;Maybe my seemingly unproductive, looking-up-at-Him life produces awe among the angels.&#x201d;</p><p>Through an eloquent exploration of both personal and biblical story, Hagerty calls us to offer every unseen minute of our lives to God. God is in the secret places of our lives that no one else witnesses. But we&#x2019;ve not been relegated to these places. We&#x2019;ve been invited.</p><p>We may be &#x201c;wasting&#x201d; ourselves in a hidden corner today: The cubicle on the fourth floor. The hospital bedside of an elderly parent. The laundry room. But these are the places God uses to meet us with a radical love. These are the places that produce the kind of unhinged love in us that gives everything at His feet, whether or not anyone else ever proclaims our name, whether or not anyone else ever sees.</p><p>God&#x2019;s invitation is not just for a season or a day. It is the question of our lives: &#x201c;When no one else applauds you, when it makes no sense, when you see no results&#x2014;will you waste your love on Me?&#x201d;</p></p><p><p>Sara Hagerty is a lover of God, a wife to Nate, and a mother of six&#x2013;four adopted from Africa and two through miracle pregnancies.

But of all the sheriffs of the frontier, one man stands out as a true hero: Bass Reeves.<br><br>He was the most successful Federal Marshal in the US in his day. True to the mythical code of the West, he never drew his gun first. He brought hundreds of fugitives to justice, was shot at countless times, and never hit. <br><br>Bass Reeves was a black man, born into slavery. And though the laws of his country enslaved him and his mother, when he became a free man he served the law, with such courage and honor that he became a legend.</p><p>Gary Paulsen is the distinguished author of many critically acclaimed books for young people, His most recent books are <i>Brian's Hunt</i>, <i>The Quilt,</i> <i>Molly McGinty Has a Really Good Day</i>, and <i>The Time Hackers</i>. The author lives in New Mexico and the Pacific Ocean.Spring 1834<br><br><i>The Witch Dog<br></i><br>The boy lay under a mesquite bush to get shade from the Texas sun and watched the cow intently.<br><br> She was a longhorn with horns a full five feet across. He'd seen horns that size cut men and kill horses, so he waited. She was about to go into labor, what he called getting calf sick, and when she was actually having the calf she couldn't attack him. Then he would run up, drop a noose around her head and dance back before one of those horns could catch him. The rope was twenty feet long and tied to a four-foot piece of log about five inches in diameter. When the cow tried to run, the log would tangle in the mesquite and rocks and stop her so she could be captured, branded and added to the mister's herd to sell and make him rich.<br><br> The cow moved and he studied her with a knowing eye. She was huge for a cow, with flat sides and many scars from running through brush and fighting other cows.<br><br> It would be another half hour, at least, before labor. She wasn't even hunched yet.<br><br> "You take the rope and the log," the mister had told him. The boy never thought of him as the master, though legally he was, like all white men who owned slaves. The boy's mammy had told him: "Your name is Bass, and ain't no man your master. Not now. Not ever. We got to do what we got to do 'cause of the white man's law. But that don't make no man your master in God's eyes."<br><br> Bass studied the horns. They came around so fast, and sharp, sometimes you almost couldn't see them move. Once he moved in too close on an old brindle cow and just the tip of a horn caught his trousers. Cut them open like a knife.<br><br> "Zzzzzttt!" The cloth almost sang. They were no-'count pants anyway, handed down from the mister, all patches and held up with a piece of tow over his shoulder. He knew his mammy would sew them up, but he didn't like the feel of the horn swinging by that close.<br><br> Another inch and I'd have been looking at my guts, he thought, squinting in the sun. Pulled out on a horn like wet rope. He'd seen cow and pig guts when they slaughtered, horse guts once when a bull hooked a mare that wasn't paying attention. He did not want to see his own.<br><br> Now he heard movement in the mesquite off to the right and waited. Might be the mister sneaking to see if he was working. Make sure he was doing.<br><br> No need at all, he thought. I work all the time. Not for the mister. I work because it makes the time pass.<br><br> It was two coyotes, low on their bellies. They knew there would soon be afterbirth for them to eat.<br><br> Bass watched them. They did not know he was there, back in the shady hole where he'd had to scare out a rattlesnake. The snake had buzzed some and then left when he pushed it with a stick. He didn't like snakes. He wasn't afraid of them-how could you be scared of something that couldn't crawl faster than a slow walk?-but they were always mad. Seems like they bit just to be mean. His mammy told him of one that crawled in a cradle and bit a baby and killed it. Why? Baby wasn't doing a thing. Sometimes Bass killed snakes, especially around the house where they could get a dog or cat or baby pig or a chicken. But when he was out in the mesquite or down at the creek bottom, he let them be. If, he thought, they let me be. He didn't like killing things without a good reason.<br><br> The mister, now, would take his percussion pistol and shoot anything. Lizards off a rock, songbirds off a rail. Or try to. Whenever he got hold of a whiskey jug, he couldn't hit the ground, let alone a bird on a fence.<br><br> Now, it was something, how the coyotes knew when a cow was ready. Maybe the smell, Bass thought, or they might be witch dogs. His mammy told him that, back in New Orleans where she was from, there were witch dogs that could tell you things if you knew how to understand them. She didn't know how to talk to the dogs but her mammy could do it, could give a witch dog molasses, and when it wrinkled its lips to lick the molasses off its tongue, she could tell if someone was going to die or when they would have a baby, and was it a boy or a girl.<br><br> "Mammy said the power skips," Bass's mammy told him. "Didn't come to me, but maybe to you, to read the witch dogs. Mostly women have it, but I didn't have a girl and won't be no more chirrun. So if it happens, it will have to be you."<br><br> Bass was seven when his mammy told him that, better than three years ago come fall. He had lifted a jug of blackstrap molasses from the pump house and tried it on one of the mister's old tick hounds. He tried it so often the dog took a liking to it and followed him around all day, waiting to have his tongue wiped with molasses.<br><br> Problem was, Bass remembered now as he watched the coyotes move toward the cow, problem was it gave the hound the black skoots. Dog messed the yard and the pump house and all over the porch, and Bass had to quit because the mister said he was going to shoot the hound if he didn't stop messing.<br><br> Bass never learned anything from the hound but that it liked molasses and had a straight pipe for a gut. It was a good dog and Bass felt bad when one day a snake cooling itself by the pump house bit it between the eyes. Killed that hound. After that, whenever Bass saw a snake in the yard, he would get a hoe and chop it and feed it to the pigs.<br><br> There. The cow hunched. Her labor was starting. Bass gathered the rope and the log. The coyotes saw him and one looked straight into Bass's eyes and moved its lips.<br><br> At first he couldn't believe what he saw. The coyotes were thirty-five yards away, just past the head of the cow, but when Bass shook his head, the coyote was still looking at him, straight up into his eyes. And the animal's lips moved.<br><br> Things will change.<br><br> Bass wasn't sure if he heard it or felt it like a touch on his skin, but the phrase was there. In his head. As clear as if somebody had said it aloud. And it came from the coyote.<br><br> Things will change.<br><br> "What will change?"<br><br> He said it so loud that the coyotes both jumped and the cow started and turned to see him for the first time, though she didn't move, couldn't move now that her labor had begun.<br><br> The coyotes didn't answer him, either aloud or in his head, but they didn't run. Instead they stood, one looking at the cow, the other staring directly at Bass.<br><br> "Are you a witch dog?" Bass said.</p><h2>Cowboys and Cowgirls: YippeeYay!</h2><p><b>Grab your wide-brimmed hat, chaps, and spurs--let's round 'em up and move 'em along!

Few offer us the lessons that Elijah does.</p> <p>Looking for God's provision? Elijah dealt with that. Trying to believe God when everything in the natural is against you? Elijah dealt with that too.

Follow her @AlwynFJH.<b>ONE</b><br><br>They said the only folks who belonged in Deadshot after dark were the ones who were up to no good. I wasn&#x2019;t up to no good. Then again, I wasn&#x2019;t exactly up to no bad neither.&nbsp;<br><br> I slid from Blue&#x2019;s saddle and tethered her to a post behind some bar called the Dusty Mouth. The kid sitting against the fence was sizing me up suspiciously. Or maybe that was just his two black eyes. I tugged the wide brim of my hat lower as I stepped out of the yard. I&#x2019;d stolen the hat from my uncle, along with the horse. Well, borrowed, more like. Everything I owned belonged to my uncle anyway, according to law, down to the clothes on my back.<br><br> The doors of the bar banged open, spilling out light and noise and a fat drunk with his arm around a pretty girl. My hand snapped to my sheema before I could think better of it, checking it was still tightly fastened so the better part of my face was covered. I was wrapped up to my eyes, and even hours after sunset I was sweating under the padding like a sinner at prayers. I figured I looked more like some lost nomad than a real sharpshooter, but so long as I didn&#x2019;t look like a girl it didn&#x2019;t much matter. Tonight I was getting out of here with at least my life. All the better if I got out with a few coins in my pocket, too.<br><br> It wasn&#x2019;t hard to spot the pistol pit on the other side of Deadshot. It was the noisiest building in town, and that wasn&#x2019;t saying nothing. A great big gutted-out barn at the end of the dusty street, it was swarming with bodies and blazing with light, propped up against a half-collapsed prayer house with a boarded-up door. Might be that once upon a time the barn had served some honest horse trader, but that was years ago by the looks of things.<br><br> The crowd thickened the closer I got. Like buzzards swarming to a fresh carcass.<br><br> A man with a bloody nose was pinned up against a wall by two others while another drove his fist into the man&#x2019;s face over and over. A girl called out from a window with words that&#x2019;d make an iron dragger blush. A group of factory workers still in their uniforms huddled around a nomad in a busted-up wagon who was shouting about selling Djinni blood that&#x2019;d grant good folks their hearts&#x2019; desires. His wide grin looked desperate in the oily lamplight, and no wonder. It&#x2019;d been years since anyone round these parts had seen a real live First Being, let alone a Djinni. Besides, he should&#x2019;ve known better than to think desert dwellers would believe Djinn bled anything other than pure fire&#x2014;or that anyone in Deadshot would believe themselves good folk. Everybody in the Last County went to prayers enough to know better on both counts.<br><br> I tried to keep my eyes forward, like I&#x2019;d seen it all before.<br><br> If I climbed past the buildings, I&#x2019;d be able to look across the sand and scrub all the way home to Dustwalk, though there&#x2019;d be nothing but dark houses. Dustwalk got up and went down with the sun. Good honest behavior didn&#x2019;t belong to the dark hours of the night. If it were possible to die of boredom, everyone in Dustwalk would be corpses in the sand.<br><br> But Deadshot was alive and kicking.<br><br> No one paid me much mind as I slid into the barn. A big crowd was already gathered in the pistol pit. Lines of huge oil lamps hung from the eaves, giving the gawkers&#x2019; faces a greasy glow. Scrawny kids were setting up targets and dodging a big man&#x2019;s blows as he shouted at them to move faster. Orphans, by the looks of them. Likely kids whose fathers had worked in the hulking weapons factory on the outskirts of Dustwalk until they&#x2019;d gotten blown to bits by faulty machinery. Or until the day they&#x2019;d gone to work drunk and burned themselves too badly to live. Gunpowder wasn&#x2019;t hardly safe work.<br><br> I was so busy staring that I nearly walked straight into the giant of a man at the door. &#x201c;Front or back?&#x201d; he demanded, his hands resting carelessly on a scimitar on his left hip and a gun on his right.<br><br> &#x201c;What?&#x201d; I remembered just in time to pitch my voice lower. I&#x2019;d been practicing imitating my friend Tamid all week, but I still sounded like a boy instead of a man. The hired muscle at the door didn&#x2019;t seem to care.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s three fouza to stand at the back, five to stand at the front. Betting starts at ten.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;How much to stand in the middle?&#x201d; Damn. I hadn&#x2019;t meant to say that. Aunt Farrah had been trying to smack the smart mouth off me for a year now with no luck. I got the feeling it would hurt more if this man tried.<br><br> But he just frowned like he thought I might be simple. &#x201c;Front or back. There&#x2019;s no middle, boy.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not here to watch,&#x201d; I said before I could lose the last of my nerve. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m here to shoot.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What are you doing wasting my time, then? You want Hasan.&#x201d; He shoved me toward a heavyset man with billowing, bright red trousers and a dark beard slicked to his chin, standing behind a low table piled with coins that bounced as he drummed his fingers.<br><br> I took a deep breath through my sheema and tried to look like my stomach wasn&#x2019;t trying to escape through my mouth. &#x201c;How much to enter?&#x201d;<br><br> The scar on Hasan&#x2019;s lip made it look like it curled up in a sneer. &#x201c;Fifty fouza.&#x201d;<br><br> Fifty? That was almost everything I had. Everything I&#x2019;d been saving up in the last year to escape to Izman, the capital of Miraji.<br><br> Even with my face covered from the nose down, Hasan must&#x2019;ve seen the hesitation. His attention was already wandering past me, like he figured I was about to walk away.<br><br> That was what did it. I dropped the money on the table in a jangling handful of louzi and half-louzi that I&#x2019;d scrimped one by one over the past three years. Aunt Farrah always said I didn&#x2019;t seem to mind proving myself dumb if it meant proving someone else wrong. So maybe Aunt Farrah was right.<br><br> Hasan eyed the coins skeptically, but when he counted them with the speed of a professional money-grubber he couldn&#x2019;t deny it was all there. For a brief moment the satisfaction tamped down on my nerves.<br><br> He shoved a piece of wood at me that dangled from a loop of string like a pendant. The number twenty-seven was painted in black on it. &#x201c;Had much practice with a gun, twenty-seven?&#x201d; Hasan asked as I put the string over my head. The tag bounced off the wraps I had forced over my chest to flatten it.<br><br> &#x201c;Some,&#x201d; I hedged. We were wanting for almost everything in Dustwalk, in the whole Last County for that matter. Food. Water. Clothes. There were only two things we had too much of: sand and guns.<br><br> Hasan snorted. &#x201c;Then you ought to know enough to keep your hands from shaking.&#x201d;<br><br> I pressed my hands close to my body to still them as I walked into the pit. If I couldn&#x2019;t hold a gun steady it wouldn&#x2019;t much matter that I learned to aim before I learned to read. I lined up in the sand next to a man who looked like he was mostly bones under his grubby factory uniform. Another man came to stand on my other side with a twenty-eight around his thick neck.<br><br> All around us the stands filled. The bet wranglers shouted out odds and numbers. If I were betting, I&#x2019;d wager I didn&#x2019;t have any odds. No one in their right mind would put money on some skinny boy without the guts to even lower his sheema and show his face. Maybe I could win some crazy drunk a poor man&#x2019;s fortune by proving the right-minded ones wrong.<br><br> &#x201c;Good evening, gents!&#x201d; Hasan&#x2019;s voice carried over the crowd, quieting them down. Dozens of kids ran among us handing out the pistols. A girl with braids and bare feet passed me mine. The weight was instantly comforting in my palm. I quickly flicked open the chamber; there were six bullets neatly lined up. &#x201c;Everyone knows the rules. So you&#x2019;d better play by them or, God help me, I&#x2019;ll break your cheating faces myself.&#x201d; A laugh erupted from the stands, and a few whoops. Bottles were being passed around already and men were pointing at us in that way I knew from watching my uncle trade horses. &#x201c;Round one: you got six bullets, six bottles. If you&#x2019;ve got any bottles left at the end, you&#x2019;re out. First ten line up.&#x201d;<br><br> The rest of us stayed still as numbers one to ten shuffled into place, their toes on a painted white line in the dirt. I judged it about twelve feet between them and the bottles.<br><br> A kid could make that.<br><br> Two men still managed to miss with their very first bullets. In the end only half the men hit all their marks.<br><br> One of them was twice the size of any other competitor. He was wearing what might once have been an army uniform, though it was too worn to tell for sure whether it used to be gleaming army gold or if it was just dirty with desert dust. He wore the number one painted in a bold slash across the piece of wood on his chest. He got the biggest cheer of all. There were cries of &#x201c;Dahmad! Dahmad! Champion!&#x201d; as he turned away, grabbing one of the kids scurrying around to collect broken glass. Dahmad spoke too low for me to hear, then shoved the child off. The kid came back with a bottle of brown liquor. Dahmad started chugging, lounging against the bars that separated the pit from the stands. He wouldn&#x2019;t stay champion long if he was going to wind up sloshed.<br><br> The next round was even more dismal. Just one of the shooters hit all his targets. As the losers shuffled off, I got a clear view of the winner&#x2019;s face. Whatever I&#x2019;d been expecting, this boy wasn&#x2019;t it. He wasn&#x2019;t from around here, no doubt about it; that was the first thing I noticed. Everybody around here was from around here. Nobody in their right mind would chose to be in the Last County otherwise.<br><br> He was young, maybe a few years older than I was, and dressed like one of us, wearing a green sheema carelessly round his neck and desert clothes loose enough that it was hard to tell if he was really as broad as he seemed. His hair was as black as any Mirajin boy&#x2019;s; even his skin was dark enough that he might&#x2019;ve passed for one of us. But he just wasn&#x2019;t. He had strange sharp features I&#x2019;d never seen before, with high-angled cheekbones, a straight square jaw, and eyebrows that made dark slashes above the uncanniest eyes I&#x2019;d ever seen. He wasn&#x2019;t bad-looking either, at that. A few of the men he&#x2019;d beat spat at his feet. The young foreigner&#x2019;s mouth pulled up in one corner like he was trying to keep from laughing. Then, as if sensing my eyes on him, he glanced at me. I looked away fast.<br><br> There were eleven of us left and we were jostling for space along the line with the extra body, even with me being half the size of every man here.<br><br> &#x201c;Move, twenty-seven!&#x201d; An elbow jammed into my side. My head shot up with a retort on my tongue. The retort died there as I recognized Fazim Al&#x2019;Motem sidling up next to me.<br><br> I fought the urge to curse. Fazim had taught me every curse word I knew, back when he was eight and I was six. When we were caught using them, I got my mouth scrubbed out with sand and he blamed it all on me. Dustwalk was a small town. I&#x2019;d known Fazim my whole life, hated him since I grew into some sense. These days he spent most of his time in my uncle&#x2019;s house, where I was stuck living, too, trying to get his hands under my cousin Shira&#x2019;s clothes. Every so often he&#x2019;d make a grab at a piece of me, too, when Shira wasn&#x2019;t looking.<br><br> What the hell was he doing here? Actually, with the gun in his hand, I could sort of figure.<br><br> Damn him.<br><br> It was one thing if I got myself spotted as a girl. It was a whole other thing if Fazim recognized me. I&#x2019;d been in trouble plenty since I was caught cursing, but I&#x2019;d only been beaten within an inch of my life once. It&#x2019;d been right after my mother died, when I&#x2019;d tried to borrow one of my uncle&#x2019;s horses all the way out of Dustwalk. I made it halfway to Juniper City before they caught me. I couldn&#x2019;t sit on a horse for a month when Aunt Farrah and her switch were done with me. If Aunt Farrah found out I was in Deadshot gambling stolen money, she&#x2019;d beat me until that inch felt like it had been a mile.<br><br> The smart thing would be to turn around and get out of here. Except that would mean I&#x2019;d be fifty fouza poorer. And money was in shorter supply than smarts.<br><br> I realized I was standing like a girl and straightened up before facing the targets. The kids were still racing around, lining up the bottles. Fazim tracked their movements with the barrel of his gun, calling out, &#x201c;Bang, bang, bang!&#x201d; and laughing as they flinched. I wished his gun would backfire on him and shoot that smile off his face.<br><br> The kids cleared out fast, and it was just us shooters and our bottles. We were the last group before the end of the first round. Guns were already going off all around me. I focused on my six bottles straight ahead. I could make a shot like this blindfolded. But I was being careful. I checked my distance, lined up the barrel, checked my sight. When I was satisfied, I pulled the trigger. The bottle farthest to the right exploded and my shoulders eased a little. The next three bottles went down in quick succession.<br><br> My finger pressed down on the trigger for the fifth time. A shout punctured my focus. I had no other warning before a body rammed into me.<br><br> My shot went wide.<br><br> Fazim had been shoved sideways by another shooter, ramming into me on his way to the ground, another one of the shooters on top of him. A boo went up from the crowd as Fazim scuffled in the sand with the other man. The big man from the door was already breaking up the fight. Fazim was dragged to the side by the scruff of his neck. Hasan watched them go, looking bored, then turned back to the crowd. &#x201c;Winners from this round&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; I shouted without thinking. &#x201c;I want another bullet.&#x201d;<br><br> A laugh went up around me. So much for not drawing attention to myself. My neck was burning with all the eyes on me. But this was too important. Too important not to ask. Scorn was written all over Hasan&#x2019;s face, and I felt the mix of humiliation and anger rise up in my throat in answer. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not how it works, twenty-seven. Six bullets, six bottles. No second chances.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But that&#x2019;s not fair! He pushed me.&#x201d; I gestured at Fazim, who was nursing his jaw up against the wall.<br><br> &#x201c;And this isn&#x2019;t a school yard, little boy. We don&#x2019;t need to be fair. Now you can use your last bullet and lose or get out of line and forfeit.&#x201d;<br><br> I was the only one with any bullets left. The crowd started jeering at me to get out of the way, and an angry flush rose in my hidden face.<br><br> Standing alone on the line, I raised my gun. I could feel the weight of the single bullet in the chamber. I let out one long breath that moved my sheema from where it was sticking to my lips.<br> One bullet. Two bottles.<br><br> I took two steps to my right and then half a step back. I twisted my body and tried to see it all in my mind. Dead center and I&#x2019;d never hit the second one. Clip it too far off and neither would break.<br><br> Fifty fouza.<br><br> I shut out the shouting and taunts around me. I ignored the fact that every eye in here was on me and that I&#x2019;d blown all chances of being inconspicuous. Fear crept in in its place. The same fear that had crouched in my stomach for the past three days. Since the night I&#x2019;d been crawling around my uncle&#x2019;s house after dark, on my way to Tamid&#x2019;s, and overheard Aunt Farrah say my name.<br><br> &#x201c;&#x2014;Amani?&#x201d;<br><br> I hadn&#x2019;t caught whatever had come before my name, but it was enough to make me stop.<br> &#x201c;She...</p><h2>The Fashion Book: Create Your Own Cool Looks from the Story of Style</h2><p>This sassy style guide is for teens who want to discover the stories behind their favorite looks, find their own style, and learn what makes the fashion world tick.<br><br>Packed with gorgeous images, this illustrated book for young adults takes a unique look at fashion.

Do you try to make everything work, only to find that your best efforts are largely ineffective?<br>&nbsp;<br>Christians have unknowingly embraced two errors: that following the rules guarantees a good life, and that God is important because He dispenses blessings. When God&#x2019;s blessings seem to taper off and when life doesn&#x2019;t work out, people take it upon themselves to make things work. And that creates pressure that we are all too familiar with. <br>&nbsp;<br>In <i>The Pressure&#x2019;s Off</i>, best-selling author and counselor Larry Crabb introduces you to the New Way of living. God does not guarantee ease or convenience&#x2014;or even a good outcome as the result of your obedience. But he does promise himself, no matter what the circumstances of your life.<br>&nbsp;<br>When you seek God and nothing else, the pressure truly is off you. <br><br><b>Workbook included!<br></b></p><p><b>Dr. Larry Crabb</b> is a well-known psychologist, conference and seminar speaker, Bible teacher, author, and founder-director of NewWay Ministries.

You want Him. Nothing less, not even His blessings, will do.<br><br>If you&#x2019;re walking the first path, your life is filled with pressure. Inside, where no one sees, your soul is weary. You see no way to step off the treadmill. Or life is going well, and you&#x2019;re satisfied. But you sense something&#x2019;s wrong, something&#x2019;s missing. The pressure is still there. <br><br>If you&#x2019;re walking the second path, you have hope. Your soul may be weary, your interior world may be filled with struggles no one sees, but you have hope. At times you rest. Something is alive in you; the desire of your heart is not smothered. You can taste freedom. And the taste brings joy. The first path is the Old Way. It involves a quid-pro-quo arrangement with God or, if not with God, then with the order in the universe, with the rules that make life work. If you do what you should, then you get what you want, either from a moral God who rewards good behavior or from an<br>orderly world that you effectively use. It leaves you in control of how things turn out in your life. The Old Way promises a better life filled with good things that make you happy.<br><br>But it never delivers, though it may seem to for a long time. The Old Way doesn&#x2019;t work for one reason: You never keep your end of the bargain, not completely. No one does.<br><br>The second path is the New Way. In this arrangement, God first plants a desire in your heart, a longing that actually values His presence over His blessings; then He invites you to live out that desire, to abandon yourself to what you most want. It takes you out of control, but it sets you free. The New Way promises a better hope than the good things of life. It promises nearness to God, and it delivers, though not right away and often through suffering.<br><br>Most people live the Old Way all of their lives; most people who go to church live a religious version of the Old Way. It goes something like this: If you want good kids, raise them according to Christian principles. If you want a good marriage, understand a biblical model for marriage and live up to it as closely as you can.<br><br>If you want God to bless your ministry, follow godly principles of leadership. If you want to be emotionally healthy, practice spiritual disciplines and trust Jesus for your needs.<br><br>If you want close friends, learn to accept yourself and to be vulnerable, authentic, and forgiving.<br><br>People who live the Old Way believe the Law of Linearity, a law that states there is an A that leads to the B you want. Figure out what A is, do it, and you&#x2019;ll have the life you most desire. The pressure&#x2019;s on.<br><br>People who live the New Way believe the Law of Liberty. They come as they are. They do not bathe before they approach God. They come to God for the bath. They feel no pressure to change either their inner life or their outer life, but they desire change in both spheres. And they are eager to do whatever will create the opportunity for change, even if it means dipping themselves seven times in a muddy river or marching around an enemy&#x2019;s wall for seven days and blowing trumpets. They live for the truest desire of their hearts: to know God and to enjoy Him. They do not live for a better life in this world. And when their life here is hard, when things fall apart, they most clearly reveal who they are. They&#x2019;re citizens of another world who most want what this world can never provide. So they wisely indulge their deepest desire and trust God to reveal Himself to them. That&#x2019;s the Law of Liberty.<br><br>Most of us are living the Old Way. Some of us can feel the emptiness it never fills. We&#x2019;re working hard to make life work so we can feel good.

For more information, visit her website, www.debbiemacomber.com.It was six o'clock on Valentine's Day, an hour that should have marked the beginning of a celebration&#x2014;the way it had when she and Robert were married. When Robert was alive. But tonight, on the most romantic day of the year, thirty-eight-year-old Anne Marie Roche was alone. Turning over the closed sign on the door of Blossom Street Books, she glanced at the Valentine's display with its cutout hearts and pink balloons and the collection of romance novels she didn't read anymore. Then she looked outside. Streetlights flickered on as evening settled over the Seattle neighborhood.<br><br>The truth was, Anne Marie hated her life. Well, okay, <em>hate</em> was putting it too strongly. After all, she was healthy, reasonably young and reasonably attractive, financially solvent, <em>and</em> she owned the most popular bookstore in the area. But she didn't have anyone to love, anyone who loved her. She was no longer part of something larger than herself. Every morning when she woke, she found the other side of the bed empty and she didn't think she'd ever get accustomed to that desolate feeling.<br><br>Her husband had died nine months ago. So, technically, she was a widow, although she and Robert had been separated. But they saw each other regularly and were working on a reconciliation.<br><br>Then, suddenly, it was all over, all hope gone. Just when they were on the verge of reuniting, her husband had a massive heart attack. He'd collapsed at the office and died even before the paramedics could arrive.<br><br>Anne Marie's mother had warned her about the risks of marrying an older man, but fifteen years wasn't <em>that</em> much older. Robert, charismatic and handsome, had been in his mid-forties when they met. They'd been happy together, well matched in every way but one.<br><br>Anne Marie wanted a baby.<br><br>Robert hadn't.<br><br>He'd had a family&#x2014;two children&#x2014;with his first wife, Pamela, and wasn't interested in starting a second one. When she'd married him, Anne Marie had agreed to his stipulation. At the time it hadn't seemed important. She was madly in love with Robert&#x2014;and then two years ago it hit her. This longing, this need for a baby, grew more and more intense, and Robert's refusal became more adamant. His solution had been to buy her a dog she'd named Baxter. Much as she loved her Yorkie, her feelings hadn't changed. She'd still wanted a baby.<br><br>The situation wasn't helped by Melissa, Robert's twenty-four-year-old daughter, who disliked Anne Marie and always had. Over the years Anne Marie had made many attempts to ease the tension between them, all of which failed. Fortunately she had a good relationship with Brandon, Robert's son, who was five years older than his sister.<br><br>When problems arose in Anne Marie and Robert's marriage, Melissa hadn't been able to disguise her glee. Her stepdaughter seemed absolutely delighted when Robert moved out the autumn before last, seven months before his death.<br><br>Anne Marie didn't know what she'd done to warrant such passionate loathing, other than to fall in love with Melissa's father. She supposed the girl's ardent hope that her parents would one day remarry was responsible for her bitterness. Every child wanted his or her family intact. And Melissa was a young teen when Anne Marie married Robert&#x2014;a hard age made harder by the family's circumstances. Anne Marie didn't blame Robert's daughter, but his marriage to Pamela had been dead long before she entered the picture. Still, try as she might, Anne Marie had never been able to find common ground with Melissa. In fact, she hadn't heard from her since the funeral.<br><br>Anne Marie opened the shop door as Elise Beaumont approached. Elise's husband, Maverick, had recently passed away after a lengthy battle with cancer. In her mid-sixties, she was a retired librarian who'd reconnected with her husband after nearly thirty years apart, only to lose him again after less than three. She was a slight, gray-haired woman who'd become almost gaunt, but the sternness of her features was softened by the sadness in her eyes. A frequent patron of the bookstore, she and Anne Marie had become friends during the months of Maverick's decline. In many ways his death was a release, yet Anne Marie understood how difficult it was to let go of someone you loved.<br><br>"I was hoping you'd come," Anne Marie told her with a quick hug. She'd closed the store two hours early, giving Steve Handley, her usual Thursday-night assistant, a free evening for his own Valentine celebration.<br><br>Elise slipped off her coat and draped it over the back of an overstuffed chair. "I didn't think I would and then I decided that being with the other widows was exactly what I needed tonight."<br><br>The widows.<br><br>They'd met in a book group Anne Marie had organized at the store. After Robert died, she'd suggested reading Lolly Winston's <em>Good Grief,</em> a novel about a young woman adjusting to widowhood. It was through the group that Anne Marie had met Lillie Higgins and Barbie Foster. Colette Blake had joined, too. She'd been a widow who'd rented the apartment above A Good Yarn, Lydia Goetz's yarn store. Colette had married again the previous year.<br><br>Although the larger group had read and discussed other books, the widows had gravitated together and begun to meet on their own. Their sessions were often informal gatherings over coffee at the nearby French Caf� or a glass of wine upstairs at Anne Marie's.<br><br>Lillie and Barbie were a unique pair of widows, mother and daughter. They'd lost their husbands in a private plane crash three years earlier. Anne Marie remembered reading about the Learjet incident in the paper; both pilots and their two passengers had been killed in a freak accident on landing in Seattle. Lillie's husband and son-in-law were executives at a perfume company and often took business trips together.<br><br>Lillie Higgins was close to Elise's age, but that was all they shared. Actually, it was difficult to tell exactly how old Lillie was. She looked barely fifty, but with a forty-year-old daughter, she had to be in her mid-sixties.<br><br>Petite and delicate, she was one of those rare women who never seemed to age. Her wardrobe consisted of ultra-expensive knits and gold jewelry. Anne Marie had the impression that if Lillie wanted, she could purchase this bookstore ten times over.<br><br>Her daughter, Barbie Foster, was a lot like her mother and aptly named, at least as far as appearances went. She had long blond hair that never seemed to get mussed, gorgeous crystal-blue eyes, a flawless figure. It was hard to believe she had eighteen-year-old twin sons who were college freshmen; Anne Marie would bet that most people assumed she was their sister rather than their mother. If Anne Marie didn't like Barbie so much, it would be easy to resent her for being so...perfect.<br><br>"Thanks for closing early tonight. I'd much rather be here than spend another evening alone," Elise said, breaking into Anne Marie's thoughts.<br><br>There was that word again.<br><br><em>Alone.</em><br><br>Despite her own misgivings about Valentine's Day, Anne Marie tried to smile. She gestured toward the rear of the store. "I've got the bubble wrap and everything set up in the back room."<br><br>The previous month, as they discussed an Elizabeth Buchan novel, the subject of Valentine's Day had come up. Anne Marie learned from her friends that this was perhaps the most painful holiday for widows. That was when their small group decided to plan their own celebration. Only instead of romantic love and marriage, they'd celebrate friendship. They'd defy the world's pitying glances and toast each other's past loves and future hopes.<br><br>Elise managed a quivering smile as she peered into the back of the store. "Bubble wrap?"<br><br>"I have tons," Anne Marie informed her. "You can't imagine how many shippers use it."<br><br>"But why is it on the floor?"<br><br>"Well." It seemed silly now that Anne Marie was trying to explain. "I always have this insatiable urge to pop it, so I thought we could do it together&#x2014;by walking on it."<br><br>"You want us to step on bubble wrap?" Elise asked, sounding confused.<br><br>"Think of it as our own Valentine's dance and fireworks in one."<br><br>"But fireworks are for Independence Day or maybe New Year's."<br><br>"That's the point," Anne Marie said bracingly. "New beginnings."<br><br>"And we'll drink champagne, too?"<br><br>"You bet. I've got a couple bottles of the real stuff, Veuve Clicquot."<br><br><em>"Veuve</em> means widow, you know. The widow Clicquot's bubbly&#x2014;what else could we possibly drink?"<br><br>The door opened, and Lillie and Barbie entered in a cloud of some elegant scent. As soon as they were inside, Anne Marie locked the shop.<br><br>"Party time," Lillie said, handing Anne Marie a white box filled with pastries.<br><br>"I brought chocolate," Barbie announced, holding up a box of dark Belgian chocolates. She wore a red pant-suit with a wide black belt that emphasized her petite waist. Was there no justice in this world? The woman had the figure of a goddess and she ate <em>chocolate?</em><br><br>"I read that dark chocolate and red wine have all kinds of natural benefits," Elise said.<br><br>Anne Marie had read that, too.<br><br>Lillie shook her head in mock astonishment. "First wine and now chocolate. Life is good."<br><br>Leading the way to the back room, Anne Marie dimmed the lights in the front of the shop. Beside the champagne and flutes, she'd arranged a crystal vase of red roses; they'd been a gift from Susannah's Garden, the flower shop next door. All the retailers on Blossom Street were friends. Hearing about the small party, Alix Turner from the French Caf� had dropped off a tray of cheese, crackers and seedless green grapes, which Anne Marie had placed on her worktable, now covered with a lacy cloth. Lydia had insisted they use it for their celebration. It was so beautiful it reawakened Anne Marie's desire to learn to knit.<br><br>She wished she could see her friends' gifts as more than expressions of sympathy, but her state of mind made that impossible. Still, because of the other widows, for their sake as well as her own, she was determined to try.<br><br>"This is going to be fun," Elise said, telling them why Anne Marie had spread out the bubble wrap.<br><br>"What a wonderful idea!" Barbie exclaimed.<br><br>"Shall I pour?" Anne Marie asked, ignoring the sense of oppression she couldn't seem to escape. It had been present for months and she'd thought life would be better by now. Perhaps she needed counseling. One thing was certain; she needed <em>something.</em><br><br>"By all means," Lillie said, motioning toward the champagne.<br><br>Anne Marie opened the bottle and filled the four glasses and then they toasted one another, clicking the rims of the flutes.<br><br>"To love," Elise said. "To Maverick." Her voice broke.<br><br>"To chocolate!" Barbie made a silly face, perhaps to draw attention away from Elise's tears.<br><br>"And the Widow's champagne," Lillie threw in.<br><br>Anne Marie remained silent.<br><br>Although it'd been nine months, her grief didn't seem to diminish or become any easier to bear. She worked too much, ate too little and grieved for all the might-have-beens. It was more than the fact that the man she'd loved was dead. With his death, she was forced to give up the dream of all she'd hoped her marriage would be. A true companionship&#x2014;and the foundation of a family. Even if she were to fall in love again, which seemed unlikely, a pregnancy past the age of forty was risky. The dream of having her own child had died with Robert.<br><br>The four sipped their champagne in silence, each caught up in her own memories. Anne Marie saw the sorrow on Elise's face, the contemplative look on Lil-lie's, Barbie's half smile.<br><br>"Will we be removing our shoes in order to pop the bubble wrap?" Lillie asked a moment later.<br><br>"Mom has this thing about walking around in stocking feet," Barbie said, glancing at her mother. "She doesn't approve."<br><br>"It just wasn't done in our household," Lillie murmured.<br><br>"There's no reason to take our shoes off," Anne Marie said. "The whole idea is to have fun. Make a bit of noise, celebrate our friendship and our memories."<br><br>"Then I say, let 'er rip," Elise said. She raised her sensibly shod foot and stomped on a bubble. A popping sound exploded in the room.<br><br>Barbie went next, her step firm. Her high heels effectively demolished a series of bubbles.<br><br><em>Pop. Pop. Pop.</em><br><br><em>Pop.</em><br><br>Lillie followed. Her movements were tentative, almost apologetic.<br><br><em>Pop.</em><br><br>Anne Marie went last. It felt...good. Really good, and the noise only added to the unexpected sense of fun and exhilaration. For the first time since the party had begun, she smiled.<br><br>By then they were all flushed with excitement and champagne. The others were laughing giddily; Anne Marie couldn't quite manage that but she could <em>almost</em> laugh. The ability to express joy had left her when Robert died. That wasn't all she'd lost. She used to sing, freely and without self-consciousness. But after Robert's funeral Anne Marie discovered she couldn't sing anymore. She just couldn't. Her throat closed up whenever she tried. What came out were strangled sounds that barely resembled music, and after a while she gave up. It'd been months since she'd even attempted a song.<br><br>The popping continued as they paraded around on the bubble wrap, pausing now and then to sip champagne. They marched with all the pomp and ceremony of soldiers in procession, saluting one another with their champagne flutes.<br><br>Thanks to her friends, Anne Marie found that her mood had begun to lift.<br><br>Soon all the bubbles were popped. Bringing their champagne, they sat in the chairs where the reader groups met and toasted each other again in the dimly lit store.<br><br>Leaning back, Anne Marie tried to relax. Despite her earlier laughter, despite spending this evening with friends, her eyes filled with tears. She blinked them away, but new tears came, and it wasn't long before Barbie noticed. Her friend placed a reassuring hand on Anne Marie's knee.<br><br>"Does it ever hurt any less?" Anne Marie asked. Searching for a tissue in her hip pocket, she blotted her eyes. She hated breaking down like this. She wanted to explain that she'd never been a weepy or sentimental woman. All her emotions had become more intense since Robert's death.<br><br>Lillie and Barbie exchanged knowing looks. They'd been widows the longest.<br><br>"It does," Lillie promised her, growing serious, too. "But it takes time."<br><br>"I feel so alone."<br><br>"That's to be expected," Barbie said, passing her the box of chocolates. "Here, have another one. You'll feel better."<br><br>"That's what my grandmother used to say," Elise added. "Eat, and everything will seem better."<br><br>"Mine always said I'd be good as new if I did something for someone else," Lillie said. "Grams swore that showing kindness to others was the cure for any kind of unhappiness."<br><br>"Exercise helps, too," Barbie put in. "I spent many, many hours at the gym."<br><br>"Can't I just buy something?" Anne Marie asked plaintively, and hiccuped a laugh as she made the suggestion.</p><h2>Families, Professionals, and Exceptionality: Positive Outcomes Through Partnerships and Trust, Pearson eText with Loose-Leaf Version -- Access Card Package</h2><p><p> <b>This title is only available as a loose-leaf version with Pearson eText.</b> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>From the best-known authors in the field of family and professional collaboration&#x2014;here is a practical look at how teachers and families can empower, collaborate, and advocate for children with special needs.

If you want to attract the widest range of birds to your home, you need to plant a diversity of native plants. Why go green? Native plants live longer; they are drought resistant, take less water and fertilizer, they cost less, are less work and easier to maintain. And a big plus&#x2014;they are good for the environment. <br><br>In 2007, Douglas Tallamy published the groundbreaking book, Bringing Nature Home, on going native to protect wildlife. Since then Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, the National Wildlife Federation, and National Audubon have all endorsed and encouraged gardening with native plants. <br><br>Planting Native to Attract Birds to Your Yard is the first book to cover planting native to specifically attract birds. The book recommends plants for all types of backyards, no matter how large or small&#x2014;from large plots to container gardens. Sorenson gives state-specific recommendations for 31 Eastern U.S. states&#x2014;including and east of Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas, and Louisiana to the East Coast, and from the Canadian border to the Gulf Coast&#x2014;for native plants that support birds during the four seasons. The book covers the full gamut of native plants&#x2014;nearly 200 species of trees, shrubs, vines, grasses, and perennials&#x2014;and gives details on why specific plants are bird friendly and how to choose plants that work successfully in attractive home landscapes.

Yet we find it difficult in our frenetic world to keep our minds focused for long. All kinds of external noise and inner voices clamor for our attention. How can we slow down and quiet down so as to truly wait on the Lord? Nan Lewis Doerr and Virginia Stem Owens offer a solution that calls on the physical senses to break through to the spiritual -- praying with beads.<br><br> The use of prayer beads, which has a long history in practical spirituality, is now becoming more widespread among Protestants. Doerr and Owens here show readers how to use what have become known as Anglican or Christian prayer beads. Readers can then use the basic prayer structure provided by the beads to pray their way through each day -- morning, noon, and night -- and through the church year. These prayers -- a thoughtfully chosen combination of quotations from Scripture and gleanings from the Book of Common Prayer -- can be enhanced and enriched by the mindful and meditative practice of using beads.<br><br> Doerr and Owens encourage readers to use beads as "something to hang onto, a lifeline to the Presence that lies, often hidden or forgotten, at the center of our lives." Praying with beads, as outlined and embodied in this little book, has the potential to transform one's prayer life.</p><p>Virginia Stem Owens is a writer and former director of the Milton Centre at Newman University, Wichita, Kansas. She is now a member of the editorial board of Books and Culture.<b><i>Grand Rapids Press</i></b><br> "The daily prayers here work for any person eager to deepen their prayer life."<br><br><b>Phyllis Tickle</b><br> &#x2014; author of&nbsp;<i>The Divine Hours</i><br> "This is an important book in the original sense of that adjective: it is a book that 'imports' to the church something that was lost in the Reformation and has been sorely missed during the centuries since. Protestant Christians, whether liturgical or not, will find here not only a missing part of their heritage, but also much counsel and instruction for their future practice of the faith."<br><br><b>Lauren F. Winner</b><br> &#x2014; author of&nbsp;<i>Girl Meets God</i><br> "Praying with beads has been a terrifically important practice to me over the last few years. How thrilled I am to discover Nan Doerr and Virginia Stem Owens's wonderful introduction to this age-old practice. I know this book will shape my own devotional life, and I am excited about the many people who will discover prayer beads through these pages."</p><h2>Senior Leadership Teams: What It Takes to Make Them Great (Center for Public Leadership)</h2><p>An organisation's fate hinges on its CEO&#x2014;right? Not according to the authors of <i>Senior Leadership Teams</i>. They argue that in today's world of neck-snapping change, demands on leaders in top roles are rapidly outdistancing the capabilities of any one person - no matter how talented. Result? Chief executives are turning to their enterprise's senior leaders for help. Yet many CEOs stumble when creatinga leadership team. One major challenge is that senior executives often focus more on their individual roles than on the top team's shared work. Without the CEO's careful attention to setting the team up correctly, these high-powered managers often have difficulty pulling together to move their organisation forward. Sometimes they don't even agree about what constitutes the right path forward.The authors explain how to determine whether your organisation needs a senior leadership team. Then, drawing on their study of 100+ top teams from around the world, they explain how to create a clear and compelling purpose for your team, get the right people on it, provide structure and support, and sharpen team members' competencies - and your own. Timely and practical, this book enables you to create and sustain a leadership team whose members learn from one another while collaborating to pursue your company's objectives.<br></p><p>J.

And then, as U.S. ambassador to Russia from 2012 to 2014, he had a front-row seat when this fleeting, hopeful moment crumbled with Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s return to the presidency.

From the first days of McFaul&#x2019;s ambassadorship, the Kremlin actively sought to discredit and undermine him, hassling him with tactics that included dispatching protesters to his front gates, slandering him on state media, and tightly surveilling him, his staff, and his family.<br><br><i>From Cold War to Hot Peace </i>is an essential account of the most consequential global confrontation of our time.</p><p>MICHAEL MCFAUL is a professor of political science and director of&nbsp;the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford University.

He combines a clear biblical knowledge with an excellent grasp of doctrine from a historical Reformed perspective and is able to press home a rich application of each aspect of truth to the development of personal holiness. These applications are not trite, but arise from knowledge of the church&#x2019;s best soul doctors. My wife and I have been reading this each evening and have profited greatly. Each chapter can be managed in less than five minutes but provides an evening&#x2019;s worth of rich reflection.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Tom J.

Joe Thorn brings this truth to bear on a new generation in <em>Note to Self</em>. It&#x2019;s filled with pastoral concern and practical advice packaged as brief notes. I&#x2019;ve been looking for a book like this my entire Christian life, and it&#x2019;s every bit as good as I hoped it would be.

He is equally noted for his preaching and writing. But in this Long Line Profile, Dr. Steven J. Lawson considers the unique focus and commitment with which Edwards sought to live out the Christian faith.</p><p>Lawson examines Edwards&#x2019; life through the lens of the seventy resolutions he penned in his late teens, shortly after his conversion, which cover everything from glorifying God to repenting of sin to managing time. Drawing on Edwards&#x2019; writings, as well as scholarly accounts of Edwards&#x2019; life and thought, Lawson shows how Edwards sought to live out these lofty goals he set for the management of his walk with Christ. In Edwards&#x2019; example, he finds helpful instruction for all believers.</p></p><p>Dr. Steven J. Lawson is the senior pastor of Christ Fellowship Baptist Church in Mobile, Alabama. A graduate of Texas Tech University (B.B.A.), Dallas Theological Seminary (Th.M.), and Reformed Theological Seminary (D.Min.), Dr. Lawson is the author of fourteen books, including The Expository Genius of John Calvin, Foundations of Grace, Famine in the Land, and a two-volume commentary on the Psalms in the Holman Old Testament Commentary Series. Dr. Lawson and his wife, Anne, have three sons, Andrew, James, and John, and a daughter, Grace Anne.<p>&#x201c;Tired of going at the Christian life in piecemeal fashion? Tired of half-hearted pursuits? Then you&#x2019;ve come to the right book. Here Steven Lawson artfully points you to Jonathan Edwards, a model for pursuing holiness, humility, and love, and for the forsaking of sin&#x2014;all driven by a relentless passion &#x2018;to glorify God and enjoy him forever.&#x2019; When Edwards wrote his &#x2018;Resolutions,&#x2019; he likely had no idea how much they would impact his life. Beware, they&#x2019;ll do the same for you.&#x201d;</p> -- Dr. Stephen J. Nichols<br><br><p>&#x201c;The growing embrace of Reformed thought in the past quarter of a century has been very encouraging to those of us who delight in this most biblical expression of Christianity. And the remarkable writings of Jonathan Edwards have, by the grace of God, played no little part in this expansion of Reformed theology. This new volume by Steve Lawson helps to locate the root of Edwards&#x2019; thinking in his close walk with God. It serves as a powerful reminder that Reformed orthodoxy and Reformed piety belong together, and that to focus on the former at the expense of the latter is not only un-Edwardsean, but also un-biblical.&#x201d;</p> -- Dr. Michael A.G. Haykin<br><br><p>&#x201c;The pursuit of a regimented godliness is not unique to Christianity, but it is rare. Unlike popular versions of the Christian faith, Jonathan Edwards did not seek the disciplines of godliness for utilitarian ends, the self-help preoccupation of Western Christianity. He saw conformity to Christ as a means, the only means, to glorify God. Steve Lawson has done a wonderful service, producing in a tactful and pastoral manner Edwards&#x2019; pious resolutions, thereby helping us understand the inner life, the spiritual struggles and goals, of perhaps America&#x2019;s greatest intellect.&#x201d;</p> -- Dr. John D.

Standing before them was a fugitive with a harsh black hack job of a haircut and a smoldering fury in her hazel stare.<br><br> Twist tipped the head of his cane toward her. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t leave us in the lurch like that.&#x201d;<br><br> They locked eyes, and after a few seconds, she nodded, snapped open the blades of the bolt cutters, didn&#x2019;t bother to apologize. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got things to do.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Like what?&#x201d; asked Cade. He was a tall, tanned kid, seventeen, with shoulder-length Jesus hair.<br><br> &#x201c;Like revenge.&#x201d;<br><br> For a long moment, everyone in the room just looked at her. Then Odin slowly stood, body stiff, moving as though his bones hurt, and did something he hadn&#x2019;t done in weeks--he smiled.<br><br> Cruz, the ex&#x2013;gang member from East L.A., simply held out his hand, and Shay passed him the bolt cutters.<br><br> &#x201c;These&#x2019;ll work,&#x201d; Cruz said, snapping the heavy jaws.<br><br> Shay was studying the woman on the bed. She was Asian, with delicate features gone gaunt from months of stress and pain. &#x201c;She looks worse than when I left.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;She had another seizure,&#x201d; Odin said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re so violent. That was the third since--&#x201d;<br><br> The chained woman was coming around: she tilted her head up at Odin and whispered, &#x201c;Water.&#x201d; Odin grabbed a cup off the nightstand and held it to the woman&#x2019;s lips. She drank it all, greedily, then lay back on the bed.<br><br> &#x201c;Where&#x2019;re we cutting?&#x201d; Twist asked.<br><br> The woman was bound in a twelve-foot chain, a cold metal boa constrictor that circled her slender waist and looped like handcuffs around her wrists and ankles. Each set of loops was cinched with a U-shaped padlock.<br><br> &#x201c;Start at her waist,&#x201d; Shay said to Cruz. Shay pulled the chain as far off the woman&#x2019;s body as she could, about three inches, and Cruz carefully gripped a link in the blades and squeezed. It broke in half with a quiet pop.<br><br> Twist: &#x201c;Cade, pick up the chain and the padlocks, wipe them, stick them in a pillowcase. We&#x2019;ll dump it in the trash somewhere.&#x201d;<br><br> Cade grabbed a pillow, and Cruz moved on to the woman&#x2019;s wrists and then ankles.<br><br> &#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t move,&#x201d; Cruz said, positioning the blades on the chain. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t wanna cut you. . . .&#x201d;<br><br> When the woman&#x2019;s chafed and bloodied wrists were free, she groaned in relief and said, &#x201c;Thank you&#x201d; and &#x201c;More water, please?&#x201d;<br><br> Odin got her another cup of water. Twist packed a pillow behind her back and said, &#x201c;Better?&#x201d;<br><br> She took another long drink and looked around the bed at the six of them: four men, a girl, and a dog with mismatched yellow and blue eyes. The dog sat away from her, but his nose was working hard, sniffing at the blood on her ankles.<br><br> As a group, her rescuers looked more than a little tattered: teenagers, mostly, the girl had a swollen lip, the long-haired kid had recently been hit in the face, the heavily muscled Hispanic had a bandage wrapped around one hand, the older man, perhaps thirty, was leaning on a cane. Her grateful gaze settled on Odin--Odin, the boy with gingery whiskers who&#x2019;d been imprisoned in the same Singular warehouse. He&#x2019;d cradled her head in the back of a truck as they&#x2019;d fled from the scene. Now he patted her arm awkwardly and said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re safe.&#x201d;<br><br> Twist asked, &#x201c;Can you talk?&#x201d;<br><br> She nodded and put the cup down. &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br> Shay: &#x201c;What did they do to you?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;They put an American woman into my mind,&#x201d; she said in precise, heavily accented English.<br><br> &#x201c;Into your mind? You mean . . . What do you mean?&#x201d; Twist asked. He sat on the end of the bed, his cane between his knees.<br><br> The woman rubbed at her sore wrists and said: &#x201c;I have memories that are not my life, I know things that are not my knowing. . . . I am unable to think only for myself.&#x201d;<br><br> The rescuers looked at each other, and Twist said, &#x201c;They&#x2019;re that close. This is science fiction.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s depraved,&#x201d; Odin said. &#x201c;They drilled into her head just like they did all those poor monkeys--&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Monkeys?&#x201d; the woman asked.<br><br> Shay gave her brother a look that said not now, but the woman had a flicker of understanding.</p><h2>The Art of Game Design: A Deck of Lenses, Second Edition</h2><p>Would you like to design world-class games?

It was like Christmas came in the spring and lasted all the way through summer.<br> <br>It was the first official day of baseball at Highland Park, the real center of town in Walton. The center of town and the center of baseball in the town. They had four Little League fields, all of them looking brand-new, as if the grass had been painted a perfect green and the dirt had been brought here from the big leagues for the batting box and pitcher&#x2019;s mound and base paths. Even the white numbers set against the dark blue of the outfield walls looked as if they had been painted that morning.<br> <br>From the time he&#x2019;d been old enough to play Little League, after he&#x2019;d moved up from T-ball, this field or the one next to it or the two at the other end of Highland Park had felt like Jack&#x2019;s home away from home.<br> <br>Always, no matter what else was going on, he&#x2019;d felt happy here, and safe.<br> <br>Safe at home.<br> <br>When they&#x2019;d arrived at the field, he&#x2019;d pointed out to his best friend, Gus Morales, how new everything looked, and Gus had said, &#x201c;Yeah, because the first day of baseball never gets old.&#x201d;<br> <br>Gus&#x2019;s family had come to the United States from Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic when Gus&#x2014;full name Gustavo Alberto Morales&#x2014;was still a baby. Gus had always told Jack that baseball in the Dominican was even more serious than Jack had read or heard. Baseball was like the national religion of Gus&#x2019;s country, and a really good ball field, like the ball fields at Highland Park, was like church.<br> <br>Gus told stories that his father had told him: stories about being so poor when he was a boy that he&#x2019;d played ball in abandoned lots or in the street, using broom handles for bats and old milk cartons for gloves.<br> <br>Maybe that was why Gus loved baseball as much as he did. Just not as much as Jack did. And as good a player as Gus was, a big first baseman with power, a lefty hitter and lefty thrower who could field as well as he could hit, he wasn&#x2019;t as good as Jack Callahan.<br> <br>Jack was the best seventh grader in town, the best pitcher and the best shortstop when he wasn&#x2019;t pitching. He&#x2019;d have been the best outfielder if his coaches had ever needed him to play out there. There were two leagues at the sixth-grade/seventh-grade level in Walton, one called the Atlantic and one called the Pacific. The best kids went to the Atlantic each year. Back in February, tryouts had been held in the gym at Walton High School. The gym was filled with baseball that day, even though it was still winter. Jack had graded higher than any other kid in town his age.<br> <br>Again.<br> <br>Nobody was supposed to know the scores, but by the time they all left the gym that day, everybody knew his.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shocker, you scoring like that,&#x201d; Gus had said. &#x201c;For you baseball&#x2019;s like this test where you already know the answers.&#x201d;<br> <br>The next week he was the first player drafted when the coaches held their draft.<br> <br>&#x201c;Another shocker,&#x201d; Gus said at the time.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know I don&#x2019;t care about any of that stuff,&#x201d; Jack had said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just glad you were still around when our team picked again.&#x201d;<br> <br>The start of the season seemed so far away to Jack then, with snow still on the ground outside, Jack thinking about the baseball season the way he always had.<br> <br>Gus had said, &#x201c;If another team had picked me, I would have demanded a trade. Dude, we&#x2019;re the team.&#x201d;<br> <br>Their team was the Rays this season. Last season they were sixth graders and good enough to play in the Atlantic division. They&#x2019;d been on the Red Sox and had rolled through the league, losing just one game before they lost in the finals by a run, bottom of the last inning.<br> <br>And this year the stakes had been raised, this year was their shot at the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. The way it worked in Walton was they sent two teams every year into the County All-Star League; one was the winner of the Atlantic, and the other a team made up of the best players from the rest of the division.<br> <br>Then the winner of the County All-Star League was the one that punched its ticket into the tournament that finally put you into the World Series if you kept winning through your region and your state.<br> <br>Gus was already obsessed&#x2014;totally&#x2014;with the chance that he might not only get to Williamsport, but play baseball on national television, because ESPN had been televising the Little League World Series since before they were both born.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know the team everybody&#x2019;s going to want to watch this summer?&#x201d; Gus was saying now at Highland Park. &#x201c;Ours.&#x201d; Then he put out his right hand to Jack and started one of those complicated fist bumps and handshakes and arm moves&#x2014;everything except a couple of dance steps&#x2014;that were sometimes more complicated to Jack than seventh-grade algebra.<br> <br>&#x201c;You think there are cameras on you even when they&#x2019;re not,&#x201d; Jack said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Exactly!&#x201d; Gus said. &#x201c;That way, when the real cameras are on me, I&#x2019;ll be ready.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t wait.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be right there with me,&#x201d; Gus said, &#x201c;because you&#x2019;re like my ticket to it all.&#x201d;<br> <br>For now, a long way from Gus&#x2019;s dream, Jack took in the scene all around them: first official day of practice, all the players on the field for the first time, players from some of the other teams in their league on the three other fields.<br> <br>Jack Callahan: back out there with Gus and the rest of the guys, taking it all in, baseball and him back together.<br> <br>Wanting to love it even more than he ever had before.<br> <br>When they took the field, he ran out to shortstop, Gus was at first, Brett Hawkins&#x2014;known as Hawk&#x2014;at third base, T. W. Stanley at second, Scott Sutter at catcher. Coach John Leonard stood next to Scott at home plate, hitting ground balls, chattering away like he was as excited as any of the players on his team to be out here today, at least as excited as his own son, Gregg, out in center field.<br> <br>All this baseball, between the green grass and the blue sky.<br> <br>&#x201c;Guy I heard on TV one time, some sportswriter, called baseball the greatest game ever invented by mortal minds,&#x201d; Coach said, then slapped a hard grounder to Jack&#x2019;s left, toward the middle of the diamond.<br> <br>Jack didn&#x2019;t hurry. The parents who&#x2019;d watched him grow up in baseball, especially the ones who&#x2019;d played ball themselves, talked about how he never rushed himself, even on the toughest plays. How sometimes he seemed to be moving to the ball before the ball was even hit.<br> <br>And how once he was in motion, it was as if he was gliding.<br> <br>So Jack was gliding to the ball now that they were on the field and in the middle of infield drills. He moved to his left after a ground ball up the middle, almost as if he knew where it was going to end up better than it did. He cut the ball off in front of the second-base bag, reached down, and felt the ball in the pocket of his Dustin Pedroia glove, the one he&#x2019;d broken in perfectly by the end of last season.<br> <br>Not even breaking stride as he kept moving to his left, to the rightfield side of second now, making the transition of glove to bare hand, his eyes picking up Gus at first base even though Jack knew he could make a play like this blindfolded. He whipped a perfect sidearm throw to Gus, perfect strike.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah!&#x201d; Gus yelled, smiling at Jack, pointing with his glove, like he wasn&#x2019;t just the happiest kid at Highland Park in that moment, but the happiest kid in the whole town.<br> <br>Jack pointed back at him and ran back to short as Coach hit the next grounder to T. W. Stanley.<br> <br>Jack took off his cap, the same blue as the one the Tampa Bay Rays wore, the logo exactly right. He used the cap to wipe some sweat off his forehead, even though his teammates said they never saw him sweat. Even though the caps they were wearing were adjustable, they still looked exactly like the ones the real Rays wore. No surprise there. They did things right in Walton when it came to baseball.<br> <br>Oh, the other sports were big here too, for boys and girls. Jack and Gus played football and basketball together, and the soccer program in town was huge. So was the lacrosse program, one that took away kids that Jack knew would have been awesome in baseball. Jack&#x2019;s father explained it by saying that the best lacrosse players in high school could usually punch their own ticket to the best colleges, and their parents wanted to get them started on that road as early as possible.<br> <br>&#x201c;You think they love lacrosse the way I love baseball?&#x201d; he&#x2019;d asked his dad one time last season.<br> <br>His dad had smiled and said, &#x201c;The only love greater than that is the one I have for you, kid.&#x201d;<br> <br>More than anything, Walton was a baseball town, in a baseball region, in a baseball state. Now, because their team looked even more loaded than it did last season, baseball in Walton felt bigger than it ever had. Everyone was dreaming about making it to Williamsport and the World Series.<br> <br>It just seemed that the guys around Jack on this field were dreaming a little bigger and a little harder, starting with Gus Morales.<br> <br>This season was going to be the one they would talk about for the rest of their lives. Gus had been saying that for weeks, from the time their team was set and they knew John Leonard was going to be their coach. Gus knew they were going to have the best team of kids their age anywhere in the state or in the region or in the country.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why stop there?&#x201d; Jack said. &#x201c;Why not the greatest team of twelve-year-olds in the history of the planet Earth?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Go ahead, mock me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If you insist,&#x201d; Jack said.<br> <br>This was when they had been stretching in the outfield grass, more to feel the grass under them than for the stretching. Gus talked about how he&#x2019;d been waiting for this day since they&#x2019;d lost to Cortland Lakes.<br> <br>Jack knew Gus Morales had great parents, a great sister, a great life being a kid in Walton. But the good life to him meant baseball, green grass underneath him and the sun high in the sky, two more hours of practice ahead of him, the whole season after that. To him, that was living.<br> <br>Gus always liked to say that he wanted to be as good as Jack, having no idea&#x2014;none&#x2014;how much Jack wanted to be him today.<br> <br>His friend, born in the Dominican and born to a love of the game, to whom none of this got old, Gus with his new first baseman&#x2019;s mitt and his new cleats and his new blue batting gloves.<br> <br>Jack had tried to stop his parents from spending as much as they had on new cleats for him&#x2014;Michael Jordan kids&#x2019; cleats&#x2014;and spending as much as they had on a new bat, way too much on the bat, a yellow-and-black Easton S1. But there was no stopping either one of them; they were on a mission. Jack&#x2019;s mom said last year&#x2019;s spikes were too small. His dad said you needed a new bat every year as you got bigger and your swing speed increased. That was just common sense.<br> <br>&#x201c;Besides,&#x201d; Jack&#x2019;s dad said, &#x201c;if you&#x2019;re going to have the best season of your life, you need the best equipment. Case closed.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was as if, Jack thought, his parents thought they&#x2019;d be playing the season right along with him. Like they wanted this season to be as great as Gus was sure it was going to be.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; It was Coach Leonard, calling out to Jack from the batter&#x2019;s box, ball in his left hand, bat on his shoulder, ready to go. &#x201c;Is my shortstop&#x2019;s head in the game, or is he staring into outer space?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry, Coach,&#x201d; Jack said. &#x201c;You got me. I zoned out there for a second.&#x201d;<br> <br>Coach Leonard was smiling. &#x201c;Season already starting to drag a little bit for you, Jack?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Little bit,&#x201d; Jack said.<br> <br>The guys around him in the infield laughed.<br> <br>They worked on double plays for a little while then, starting to read one another a little better with each play, timing their throws just right. Jack took one underhand throw from T.W. that was too high at second, high and wide to the third-base side of the bag. But Jack reached up with his bare hand, not breaking stride or losing where the bag was, making the catch and the throw to Gus in one graceful motion.<br> <br>And heard T.W. behind him say, &#x201c;You should be playing for the real Rays.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack slapped him lightly on the shoulder with his glove as he headed back to shortstop. &#x201c;You just gave me a wide-right throw to make me look good,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I wish,&#x201d; T.W. said.<br> <br>T.W. came over and stood next to Jack while Hawk fielded bunts. &#x201c;You okay?&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m good.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay to ask?&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack slapped him again with his glove and said, &#x201c;Yeah, it&#x2019;s okay. We&#x2019;re teammates, aren&#x2019;t we?&#x201d;<br> <br>Before long it was time for their first batting practice of the season. Coach Leonard said he hadn&#x2019;t set the whole batting order in his mind yet. But he said that he wanted the first four hitters today to be the four he thought he was going to put at the top of the order when the season started:<br> <br>T.W.<br> <br>Gregg.<br> <br>Jack.<br> <br>Gus.<br> <br>Coach Leonard pitched, from behind the mound. &#x201c;Stay loose, boys,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a lot more arm than an old man is supposed to have.&#x201d; When it was Jack&#x2019;s turn to hit, he walked to the plate with his new Easton in his hands&#x2014;no batting gloves for him, not one time since he&#x2019;d started playing organized ball. He wanted to feel the bat, and he was now, swinging like it was the middle of the season already.<br> <br>He pulled the first pitch he saw, hard down the leftfield line. Line drive over second next, T.W. saying it sounded like a police siren going past him. Then Jack pounded one up the gap in right-center, the ball rolling all the way to the wall.<br> <br>He told himself he might as well make these swings count.<br> <br>His next swing put the ball over the leftfield fence.<br> <br>Jack finished by dropping a perfect bunt down the third-base line, running it out like he was trying to beat the ball out in a game. Then he moved around the bases while Gus took his swings. When he got back to the bench, he grabbed his Pedroia glove, took off his batting helmet, and ran out to short.<br> <br>Now he told himself not to lose focus, not this close to the end.<br> <br>There was all this chatter while the rest of the guys hit. All of what his dad called the music of baseball. Jack&#x2019;s dad, who&#x2019;d been a star shortstop himself at Walton High School, then a good enough prospect later that he was drafted by the Red Sox out of Boston College before he decided to go to law school instead.<br> <br>&#x201c;But you&#x2019;ve got all those trophies in your office,&#x201d; Jack had said the first time his dad told him he knew he wasn&#x2019;t good enough to ever make it to the big leagues. &#x201c;And you say you loved it the way I do.&#x201d;<br> <br>And his dad had put his arm around him that day and said, &#x201c;Sometimes it&#x2019;s about more than the love of the game.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack remembered that now, for the first time in a long time, as if it had happened yesterday.<br> <br>They finished practice with some situational drills, guys taking their infield and outfield positions, other guys running the bases, some cutoff plays. Guys tried to score from second base on balls Coach Leonard would hit in front of the outfielders.<br> <br>When they were done for the day, Coach gathered the players around him in the grass behind shortstop, telling them he knew they had high expectations for themselves this season and that he was cool with that.<br> <br>&#x201c;But here&#x2019;s my biggest hope,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;That by the end of the season every one of you will be a better baseball player than he is right now.&#x201d;<br> <br>Some of the other guys, the ones whose parents hadn&#x2019;t shown up yet, went back to the outfield...</p><h2>The Shaming Eyes (A Nick Drake Novel)</h2><p><p><b>Nick Drake is back!

Dr. Roget&#x2019;s thesaurus thus reversed the access to allow the user to find a word from another word, a concept or an idea. When in 1852 Roget published the first book ever to realize this concept with thoroughness and precision, he called it a &#x201c;thesaurus&#x201d; (from the Greek and Latin, meaning &#x201c;treasury&#x201d; or &#x201c;storehouse&#x201d;).

The father tells his little son the story behind each of his tattoos, and together they go on a beautiful journey through family history. There's a tattoo from a favorite book his mother used to read him, one from something his father used to tell him, and one from the longest trip he ever took. And there is a little heart with numbers inside&#x2014;which might be the best tattoo of them all. Tender pictures by <em>New York Times</em> bestselling illustrator Eliza Wheeler complement this lovely ode to all that's indelible&#x2014;ink and love.</p><p>Alison McGhee is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Someday</em>, <em>Little Boy</em>, and <em>Making a Friend</em>. She lives in Minneapolis and Vermont.<br><br>Eliza Wheeler studied art and design at the University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Stout, and moved to Los Angeles to begin creating children's books. She is the author and illustrator of several acclaimed books for young readers, including the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>Miss Maple's Seeds</em>.PreS-Gr 1&#x2014;This is a story about how a young boy learns all about his father's life when he asks to see his tattoos. McGhee sets the stage for a fun read. The boy, "little man," first wants to hear about the dragon tattoo on his dad's right shoulder. The text explains that this winged creature is from a favorite childhood book. An accompanying illustration shows a picture of Dad as a young child sitting on his mom's lap in a country pasture underneath laundry flapping in the breeze, while listening intently to the book. The pen-and-ink illustrations look like they could be tattoos. Wheeler adeptly captures Dad's special family bonds. His forearm bears the mantra "Be Kind." The accompanying illustration shows Dad as a young boy with his father rescuing a baby bird that fell from its nest. Artwork complements the story well. Text is simple and lends itself to discussion. The story continues with the milestones in Dad's life via the tattoos. On his right upper arm, Dad has an intricate pattern that includes flowers, marking the importance of meeting his wife (the boy's mom). Another design on his side represents service overseas in the military. Of course, there is a tiny little heart with a date, which not surprisingly marks his son's birthday. The tattoos tell a story about the life of a father who loves his family. VERDICT The tender story will resonate with young audiences. The cultural relevance of the tattoo phenomena is a plus.&#x2014;Robin Sofge, Alexandria Library, VA</p><h2>Resident Evil: Zero Hour</h2><p>Sent to investigate a series of grisly murders in Racoon City, S.T.A.R.S Bravo Team scrambles into action. <br><br>Following a helicopter crash, the team stumble across a gruesome sight: an overturned military transport truck riddled with corpses - and that&#x2019;s only the beginning of their nightmare.

This time, the focus is on collections, and the 12 picture puzzles feature intriguing assortments of buttons, plastic dinosaurs, nature's autumn contributions, stuffed animals, wooden blocks, and the contents of a junk drawer. The same beaded toy figure from the other titles is also concealed in each scene. As a wordsmith, Wick offers pleasing rhymes that clearly direct readers to retrieve a requisite number of objects.

I was naked, they tell me, wrapped only in a blanket and tucked in a basket. If the Baron had not been out riding that night he would not have seen me, and I would have been buried beneath the snow by morning.<br> <br>To the surprise of Hulda, his housekeeper, the Baron didn&#x2019;t send me away. Instead, he hired a nurse to come and take care of me.<br> <br>I liked Nurse, despite her unusual fondness for toads. However when I was about five she fell into the moat and was eaten by something or other.<br> <br>After that I pretty much took care of myself.<br> <br>I had the run of the castle and could go anywhere I wanted&#x2014;except the North Tower, which was always locked. Naturally, I wanted to know what was up there. But I learned early on not to ask about it. Questions upset people.<br> <br>Not that there were many people to upset; only the Baron, Hulda, and Karl, the young man who tended the library.<br> <br>I liked Karl. He was very smart, and when he had time he would give me lessons. However, this did not happen often, because caring for the library was a big job. (The Baron owned so many books he had had to knock out the walls between seven rooms to hold them all!)<br> <br>Most of what I knew about the outside world came from the books Karl shared with me.<br> <br>The library itself was my favorite place in the castle. Its floor was covered by a thick, soft carpet, its walls made of dark wood. Mazes of tall, book-crammed shelves filled the interior. The windows, which curved out from the side of the building, were twice as tall as a man; the huge velvet curtains that covered them used to be red and were still soft and warm. On cold days I liked to take a book and curl up on one of the sills. Wrapping a curtain around me like a blanket, I would alternate between reading and staring out at the distant village, the forest, the mountains.<br> <br>I often wondered what it was like out there, beyond the castle walls that I had never left.<br> <br>From one of the windows I could see the North Tower, which was shrouded in mist on even the sunniest of days.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>One rainy evening in October Karl was repairing books, Hulda was sleeping, and the Baron was hidden away with one of the mysterious visitors that sometimes came to the castle gate. I was on my own, as usual. For some reason&#x2014;perhaps because the voices that moaned along the hallway outside my room had been so loud the night before&#x2014;I couldn&#x2019;t settle down to read.<br> <br>I went to my room and played with Mervyn, the rat I had tamed the year before. When he ran off, I decided to go to bed. Slipping out of my clothes, I pulled on my nightshirt, then drew aside the curtain surrounding my bed and climbed beneath the covers.<br> <br>I couldn&#x2019;t sleep.<br> <br>A streak of lightning sizzled through the night. I liked to watch lightning, so I got up and sat by my window. But the lightning did not continue. After a while I grew tired of watching the thick drops splat against the glass and decided to go exploring. I had been exploring the castle for years and still hadn&#x2019;t discovered everything about it&#x2014;partly because it was so huge, partly because it had so many secret passages and hidden rooms. These were what I looked for when I explored. To find them I pushed bricks, moved picture frames, and fiddled with the knobs carved in the mantelpieces of the fireplaces.<br> <br>Lighting a candle, I went to my own fireplace, which was tall enough to stand in. I pushed a certain brick and the fireplace swung around, putting me in the passage behind it.<br> <br>I had discovered this passage when I was only six. Once in it, I could get into any other room on my floor. But since it was my floor, since I was the only person living there, it didn&#x2019;t do me much good.<br> <br>The worst thing about the secret passages was that they were so dark. When I first started exploring I had tried taking torches with me, but somehow the Baron always found out and told me not to. I understood why; some passages were lined with wood, or even drapes, and it would have been easy to start a fire in them. Finally I had started carrying candles. They didn&#x2019;t provide much light, but they were better than nothing, and the Baron never said anything about them.<br> <br>About a hundred feet from my room a hidden stairway led to some secret rooms in the East Tower. Holding my candle before me, I made my way to the steps, then climbed three flights to a room dominated by a clock several feet taller than I am. I had seen this clock many times without ever really looking at it. But on this day I felt a hunch about it.<br> <br>Opening the glass-paneled door, I put my hand inside. The wood behind the counterweights seemed solid. But when I climbed a chair and moved the hands of the clock to point straight up, as if it were midnight, I heard the familiar whisper of a sliding panel. The back of the clock had disappeared!<br> <br><br> <br>I jumped off the chair. Squeezing my way through the clock&#x2019;s door, I found myself in a narrow passage. Keeping one hand against the smooth, cool stones of the wall, I moved slowly forward. Even with the candle, I didn&#x2019;t notice the stairway going down until I put my foot on a spot that wasn&#x2019;t there.<br> <br>The jolt knocked the breath out of me. Had I not been going slowly, I probably would have broken my neck falling down that stairwell, which stretched as far as I could see, no matter how high I lifted the candle.<br> <br>I began to count as I walked. Fifty steps. A hundred steps. Two hundred steps. By now I must be down among the wine cellars.<br> <br>Three hundred steps! I began to wish I had changed back into my clothes. The air was cool down here.<br> <br>I had to be far past the wine cellars now, all the way to the dungeons. I shivered. I had never been to the dungeons before. In fact, I only knew they existed because Karl had told me about them, hinting that they held dark secrets.<br> <br>Four hundred steps. Four hundred and fifty.<br> <br>How far into the earth does this stairway go? ?I wondered as I neared the five hundredth step. But number five hundred was the end of it.<br> <br>Keeping my left hand pressed against the wall, I moved slowly forward.<br> <br>Fifteen paces brought me to a wooden door held together by thick iron crosspieces.<br> <br>I could either turn back or open the door. Grasping the latch, which was enormous, I struggled to lift it without making any sound. It&#x2019;s hard to say why I felt a need to move so quietly. I was sure I was alone. But something about moving in the darkness inspires silence.<br> <br>Besides, I liked to keep secrets.<br> <br>When I managed to lift the latch the door swung open easily.<br> <br>I saw a light flickering in the distance.<br> <br>My heart began to beat more rapidly. Who could possibly be down here?<br> <br>Again I thought about turning back. But my curiosity was driving me on, and I felt confident I could move so silently no one would know I was coming&#x2014;though I don&#x2019;t think even then I really believed there was anyone there.<br> <br>I started toward the light. Soon I could tell that it came from beyond a curve in the wall. As I continued forward I could see the outlines of the stones in the floor. The wall itself was damp and slightly chilly beneath my fingers. Even so, I pressed myself against it when I reached the curve. Inching my way forward, I saw the source of the light&#x2014;a torch, stuck in a bracket.<br> <br>To my astonishment, I also heard someone singing! The voice was little more than a low growl, but the tune was rollicking.<br> <br>I could not make out the words.<br> <br>I stopped and tried to talk myself into turning back. But in my whole life I had never met anyone besides Nurse, the Baron, Hulda, and Karl. I had to know who was down here.<br> <br>Dropping to the floor, I set my candle down and began to creep forward. Beyond the torch an open door led to the source of the singing.<br> <br>Closer I crept, closer still, until I had almost reached the door. I took a deep breath.<br> <br>Slowly, ever so slowly, I poked my head around the corner.</p><h2>Christian Life and Character of the Civil Institutions of the United States</h2><p>This monumental work by Benjamin Morris documents the extensive and essential Christian contribution to the development of the United States of America.</p><p></p><h2>Fancy Nancy and the Wedding of the Century</h2><p><p><strong>*NOW A HIT TV SERIES ON DISNEY JUNIOR*</strong></p><p><strong>Fans of Fancy Nancy and weddings alike will laugh along with Nancy as she discovers how truly special a wedding can be&#x2014;whether lavish or, as this one turns out to be, more down to earth.</strong></p><p>No one is more excited than Nancy when word of her uncle&#x2019;s wedding plans spreads.

His stylistic explorations resulted in a proliferation of works on paper and canvas, with layered transparencies of vibrant pigments and earth tones culminating in luminous and ethereal soft-edged compositions. His approach to painting emphasized an experimental engagement with process in order to fully articulate a universal expression. Among Rothko&#x2019;s artistic philosophies, he held that painting was a deeply psychological and spiritual experience through which basic human emotions could be communicated.</p><p><b>Arne Glimcher</b> founded Pace Gallery in 1960 in Boston. The gallery moved to New York in 1963, and has since opened locations in Beijing, Geneva, Hong Kong, London, Palo Alto, and Seoul. Glimcher has played a critical role in the careers of many of the world&#x2019;s greatest artists, among them Jean Dubuffet, Robert Irwin, Agnes Martin, Louise Nevelson, Robert Rauschenberg, Mark Rothko, and Lucas Samaras. In addition to organizing scholarly exhibitions, he has also published widely on the history of art.

Glimcher is also the producer and director of major films including <i>Gorillas in the Mist</i>, <i>The Mambo Kings</i>, and <i>Just Cause</i>, as well as <i>Picasso and Braque Go to the Movies</i>, which he co-produced with Martin Scorsese and directed. Arne Glimcher is a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and Chairman of the Board of Directors for the African Environmental Film Foundation, which is dedicated to environmental education through film. In recognition of his commitment to the vitality of art worldwide, Glimcher was appointed Officer in the National Order of the Legion of Honor in 2003, conferred by the President of France.

Starting with basic mathematical concepts such as signs, fractions, powers and roots, logarithms, infinite series, arithmetic and geometric ratios, and the calculation of interest, Euler then discusses how to solve equations of varying degrees, methods of rendering certain formulas rational, and more. In 1771, Joseph-Louis Lagrange included an addendum to the French edition containing topics such as continued fractions and Diophantine equations.This edition of Elements of Algebra was completely re-written using Microsoft Word and its Equation Editor over the course of several months and is not just another scanned copy of John Hewlett&#39;s original English language translation. This new edition contains Euler&#39;s Part I (Containing the Analysis of Determinate Quantities) and Part II (Containing the Analysis of Indeterminate Quantities), Lagrange&#39;s Additions as well as all of the footnotes by Johann Bernoulli and others.While much of the text remains the same as that edition, several changes were made to make it more accessible to the modern reader:1. The words &#34;shew&#34; and &#34;shewn&#34; were replaced by &#34;show&#34; and &#34;shown&#34;, respectively.2. The original notation for continued fractions has been replaced with the more modern notation.3. Several German-to-English and French-to-English translation issues were resolved. 4. While the order is the same as John Hewlett&#39;s English language translation, in order to give the work more space, each chapter now begins on its own page.5. Several inline formulas were moved out-of-line to give the work more space.6. Several errors in the formulas were discovered and corrected.7. The word &#34;formulae&#34; was replace by &#34;formulas&#34;.8. The footnotes were moved to a Notes section at the end of the book.9. The overuse of the comma in several places was brought up to modern standards.It is my hope that by creating this new &#34;modern&#34; edition, a renewed interest will be generated for a work which certainly does not deserve to be forgotten, written by a brilliant mathematician considered &#34;the master of us all&#34;.[UPDATED WITH CORRECTIONS ON JULY 30, 2016.]</p><p></p><h2>Scout: Firefighter (Scout, 2)</h2><p><p><strong>The second installment of the action-packed Scout series, from the #1&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>New York Times</strong></em><strong>&nbsp;bestselling author Jennifer Li Shotz.</strong></p><p>It&#x2019;s official: Scout is now a K9 in the National Guard.

It also serves as a resource for instructors and tutors. The text presents 1,425 words that allow a student to comprehend about 95 percent of all the vocabulary they will ever see in an actual Latin text. The terms found in the present book have been culled from statistical analyses of the works of more than two hundred authors in order to identify the core vocabulary. Were students to start out by learning the 25 most common words on this list, an astonishing 29 percent of all the vocabulary ever needed would be at their command. If a student masters the 300 most frequent words in this list, well over half of all the vocabulary necessary for fluent reading will be theirs. The goal of the book is to provide the student with the most efficient way to learn vocabulary. Chapters 1 and 2, in particular, are designed for drill, review, and study. The first chapter draws together all words that share the same grammatical classification. For example, all third declension neuter nouns are brought together in one place, with their definitions. By listing the vocabulary in grammatical groups, all the words that share a set of endings are assembled for the student: vocabulary and endings thus reinforce each other. Furthermore, each list of terms is broken down into groups of five words for ease in drawing up vocabulary lists to work with. Within the grammatical lists, each part of speech is preceded by an account of how the terms within are distributed. A student thus quickly learns that while there are 413 verbs that need to be mastered, well over one-third of these (157) are found in the third conjugation, while only about one per-cent (21) will be found in the fourth conjugation. With such information, independent students or instructors can prioritize their study and assignments more appropriately. In the second chapter, large parts of the vocabulary, with their attendant definitions, are regrouped by topics. A student who wishes, therefore, to focus on nature, human emotions, or military issues, will find such vocabulary conveniently grouped together. Chapter three lists the vocabulary terms from the most frequently occurring words to the least frequent. Students or instructors who wish to lean more heavily on the most (or least!) frequently occurring terms within their drills and studies can thus consult this frequency list. After the frequency list, the fourth chapter presents an alphabetical index of the terms. Two final chapters close the text. The first is a list of endings and paradigms for nouns, adjectives and verbs. Complete paradigms and endings are given for review. The final chapter provides the student with an additional one hundred words that are uniquely common in the Latin of the Middle Ages. These one hundred words, if added to the mix, would give the student a Mediaeval vocabulary that would match the efficiency of the Classical vocabulary that is the main focus of the book. For the effort of learning an additional one hundred words, another 1,000 years of Latin texts open up before the student. As a whole, then, this book offers the vocabulary that forms the core of one thousand seven hundred years of Latin literature. If the goal is to learn to read Latin with joy and ease, then the vocabulary terms in this book are one of the major keys to success. By learning these terms, a student&#x2019;s vocabulary should be ready to tackle the Latin of any era from the Classical period to the Renaissance.</p><p>Mark A. E.

How Do You Grow? Our desire to grow runs deep. Yet the issues in our lives that we wish would change often stay the same, even with our best efforts to build ourselves up spiritually.

Henry Cloud and John Townsend shatter popular misconceptions about how God operates and how growth happens. You&#x2019;ll discover �What the essential processes are that make people grow �How those processes fit into a biblical understanding of spiritual growth and theology �How spiritual growth and real-life issues are one and the same �What the specific tasks and tips are that will help pastors, counselors, and others who assist people in growing&#x2015;and what your own responsibilities are in your personal growth Shining focused light on the great doctrines and themes of Christianity, How People Grow shows why all personal growth is spiritual growth.

Visit&nbsp;DrTownsend.com.</p>Cloud and Townsend, clinical psychologists who are the Gold Medallion Award-winning authors of Boundaries, attempt in this book to chart personal growth from a biblical perspective. Rather than suggesting that real growth happens only to Christians, they argue that most effective therapeutic methods, even those that are ostensibly secular, use biblical concepts. As such, they look to Scripture for the very best strategies for spiritual and emotional growth. While they are critical of a one-size-fits-all approach to human suffering, they do prescribe a combination of prayer, Bible study and regular contact with a 'growth group' for virtually every problem they address. The growth groups they describe are populated by healthy, vulnerable people who are willing to confront each other lovingly and own up to mistakes and failures. Cloud and Townsend argue persuasively that such groups facilitate dramatic changes in individuals' lives, but leave the logistical problem of finding such evolved folks to the reader. Perhaps the most radical message of the book is that failure is the norm, even for the most devout. Not only do the authors repeatedly give examples of the best Christians committing the worst sins, but they also insist that such wrongdoing never warrants condemnation from God or other believers. Instead, they argue, sinners must experience total acceptance and love before true repentance and change can occur. This solid, Bible-based argument against guilt and for grace is a powerful elixir for evangelicals who all too often hear the opposite message.

She won the dangerous and challenging job, and for many years traveled the badlands with her pet eagle, protecting the mail from outlaws and wild animals, never losing a single horse or package. Fields helped pave the way for other women and people of color to become stagecoach drivers and postal workers. <b></b></p><p><b>Tami Charles</b> is a former teacher who now writes picture books, middle grade and young adult novels, and nonfiction for kids.

Lenox has an eye on the matter - as a partner in a now thriving detective agency, he&#39;s a natural choice to investigate. Just when he&#39;s tempted to turn his focus to it entirely, however, his grieving brother asks him to come down to Sussex, and Lenox leaves the metropolis behind for the quieter country life of his boyhood. Or so he thinks. Something strange is afoot in Markethouse: small thefts, books, blankets, animals, and more alarmingly a break-in at the house of a local insurance agent. As he and his brother investigate this accumulation of mysteries, Lenox realizes that something very strange and serious indeed may be happening, more than just local mischief. Soon, he&#39;s racing to solve two cases at once, one in London and one in the country, before either turns deadly. Blending Charles Finch&#39;s trademark wit, elegance, and depth of research, this new mystery, equal parts Jane Austen and Charles Dickens, may be the finest in the series.</p><p>CHARLES FINCH is a graduate of Yale and Oxford.

Mixing personal anecdotes, legal cases, and journalistic reporting, Wu confronts damaging Asian-American stereotypes such as &#34;the model minority&#34; and &#34;the perpetual foreigner.&#34; By offering new ways of thinking about race in American society, Wu&#39;s work dares us to make good on our great democratic experiment.</p><p><i>Yellow</i> by Frank H. Wu is an eclectic, incisive investigation-cum-meditation that, though focusing on Asian Americans, recasts the United States' ongoing debate about racial identity in all forms. Wu suggests that the widespread stereotyping of Asian Americans, while "superficially positive," is inherently damaging. Mixing personal anecdotes, current events, academic studies, and court cases, Wu not only debunks the myth of a "model minority" but also makes discomfiting observations about attitudes toward affirmative action, what he calls "rational" discrimination, mixed marriages, racial profiling, and the "false divisions" of integration versus pluralism and assimilation versus multiculturalism. Though its conclusions are unremarkable, <i>Yellow</i> is thought provoking. The book's strength--besides its clarity and thoughtfulness--is a lack of tendentiousness. Wu prefers to suggest, not posit; muse, not shout; and ask questions, not necessarily answer them. <i>--H. O'Billovitch</i>The first Asian American to serve as a law professor at Howard University Law School in Washington, D.C., <b>Frank H. Wu</b> has written for a range of publications including the Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, the Chicago Tribune, and The Nation, and writes a regular column for Asian Week.

Determined to get to the bottom of the mystery and help her friends and family, Charlotte dives into some serious medical science. But when the doctors and other scientists don&#x2019;t take her work seriously, she sets out to find a cure on her own, determined to show that she can make a difference. This empowering story about a smart, confident bunny encourages girls to be persistent and believe in themselves.</p><p><b>Camille Andros</b> is the author of <i>Charlotte the Scientist Is Squished,</i> her picture book debut.

She lives in the forest with her large family made even bigger when her famous scientist grandpa moves in. He tells her that one day she will make a difference in the world. When a mysterious illness strikes the forest creatures, including Grandpa, Charlotte seizes the chance to make a difference. She goes to work, but after examining all the sick, she is stumped. A team of doctors arrive. Charlotte tries to share the data she gathered, but the grown-ups ignore her. Undeterred, Charlotte works harder and finally figures out that the illness is associated with some lumpy carrots that all of those afflicted ate. She determines that the carrots have "Funky Forest Fungi" and concocts a cure for both the afflicted and the carrots. Detail-oriented illustrations created with pencil, ink and finished digitally with bright colors add a lively element. The clothing-wearing forest animals go about their day, doing very human activities, including using outhouses (for the gathering of specimens) and sleeping in wrought-iron beds. The prose, while not excessively wordy, is dense at times, using a small font and challenging vocabulary. The end pages contain a glossary for science words used in the book and a message from Charlotte. Charlotte asks kids to write to her how they have made a difference using science. VERDICT Though very young listeners and readers may find this book a challenge, this is a good book for educators to share with budding scientists. -Mindy Hiatt, Salt Lake County Library Services</p><h2>A Little Tea Book: All the Essentials from Leaf to Cup</h2><p><p><b>From tea guru Sebastian Beckwith and <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers Caroline Paul and Wendy MacNaughton comes the essential guide to exploring and enjoying the vast world of tea.</b></p><p>Tea, the most popular beverage in the world after water, has brought nations to war, defined cultures, bankrupted coffers, and toppled kings.

The book still presents an evenhanded discussion of the positive and negative feelings an older child may have toward a new sibling. It shows the infant's needs and abilities and briefly touches on changes that will occur as the baby grows. While the textual differences are slight, this new edition flows more smoothly and is more immediate, as in the opening pages where the text is written in the present tense rather than in the past. The biggest change is in the photographs. Full-color pictures are used throughout; some of them take over an entire page, or even a full double-page spread. Coupled with a tighter, less blocky typeface, the overall design and presentation are more accessible and generate a greater ability for children to respond emotionally to the book. Miller captures many intimate and touching moments with her pictures and shows a wide range of feelings as demanded by the text. There is a good balance of families from varied ethnic backgrounds. As in the previous edition, this book opens with a clear and precise note to parents that gives honest, practical advice on helping youngsters prepare for and cope with a new arrival.?Martha Topol, Traverse Area District Library, Traverse City, MI<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Parrot&#39;s Fine Cuisine Cookbook: and Nutritional Guide</h2><p>What we feed our birds has a direct effect on their health and happiness.

I had already packed all my belongings, hoping to make a quick exit from campus. The note was perched atop the pile of suitcases.<br> <br>Benjamin&#x2014;<br> <br>Come see me at once.<br> <br>&#x2014;the principal<br> <br>Up to that point, I&#x2019;d been having a good day.<br> <br>To start with, I felt positive about all my exams. I&#x2019;d been working hard at the academy and had improved in all my classes in the months since I&#x2019;d arrived. I had jammed on my History of Espionage final, aced Codes and Cryptography, and squeaked through Basic Firearms and Weaponry. (I hadn&#x2019;t scored any bull&#x2019;s-eyes, but unlike some of my fellow first years, I&#x2019;d at least hit the targets and not accidentally wounded myself.) I&#x2019;d been most concerned about Intro to Self-Preservation, which had always been my weakest class, though that afternoon I had managed to last for over an hour on the training grounds against a dozen &#x201c;enemy agents&#x201d; armed with paintball guns, while much of my class had been smeared with royal blue before five minutes were up. I figured that had to be good for at least an A-minus.<br> <br>Now, I was relieved to be done with class for the summer. Although I&#x2019;d miss my friends from the Academy of Espionage, I was eager to head home, see my parents, and have a decent home-cooked meal for the first time in five months. Plus, my thirteenth birthday was only a week away. I&#x2019;d made plans to spend it with some old friends, without anyone trying to kill or maim me.<br> <br>The note, however, suggested there was trouble ahead.<br> <br>I picked it up gingerly, as though it were explosive. Frankly, I would have preferred finding a bomb in my room. I knew how to handle a bomb. The principal, on the other hand, was far more unpredictable.<br> <br>I dropped the note in my paper shredder, then burned the remains. It seemed like overkill, but this was standard procedure for all written correspondence at the Academy of Espionage, even Post-it notes. Then I set off for the principal&#x2019;s office.<br> <br>Outside, the sun was shining brightly, heralding a glorious summer. The academy, which had looked so bleak and dreary in the winter, was now far more attractive. The gothic buildings stood majestically around gorgeous green lawns fringed with flowers. Now that classes had ended, my fellow spies-in-training were reveling in the warm weather. I spotted several friends playing Ultimate Frisbee on the main commons and could hear the distinct rattle of semiautomatic weapons on the firing range in the distance.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, Smokescreen!&#x201d; a shrill voice called out. It was Zoe Zibbell, a fellow first year and my best friend, who was with a large group of students. Zoe had christened me &#x201c;Smokescreen&#x201d; as she was under the delusion that I was an incredibly talented spy&#x2014;albeit a spy who often feigned incompetence to make everyone else underestimate him. Any time I displayed my actual incompetence, Zoe inevitably thought it was a ruse. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re getting up a soccer game on Hammond Quadrangle! Want to play?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t,&#x201d; I said, then pointed to the Nathan Hale Administration Building. &#x201c;The principal wants to see me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Zoe grimaced. So did all the other students. It looked as though I&#x2019;d told them I had to go face a firing squad. &#x201c;Is something wrong?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I hope not,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, if you feel like it, come find us afterward!&#x201d; Zoe said, trying her best to be upbeat. &#x201c;We could use another striker.&#x201d;<br> <br>I nodded agreement, then entered Administration. Inside, the building was much darker and gloomier&#x2014;and my mood became much darker and gloomier as well. I trudged up the stairs to the fifth floor, had my retinas scanned, entered the secure area, and presented myself to the two guards flanking the principal&#x2019;s office door.<br> <br>One frisked me for weapons. &#x201c;State your name, rank, and business.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Benjamin Ripley, first-year student. The principal asked to see me.&#x201d;<br> <br>The second guard picked up a secure phone and announced my presence. A few seconds later, the door clicked open.<br> <br>When I entered, the principal was seated behind his desk, making a show of perusing some top secret documents. He might have looked dignified if his toupee hadn&#x2019;t been slightly askew. Or if I hadn&#x2019;t been aware that the principal was incompetent. It might seem surprising that the principal of the CIA&#x2019;s academy for future intelligence agents wasn&#x2019;t intelligent himself&#x2014;but then, both the CIA and the academy are run by the government. &#x201c;Sit down, Ripley,&#x201d; the principal told me.<br> <br>I sat on the ancient couch across from his desk. It smelled like body odor and chloroform.<br> <br>&#x201c;My sources tell me you&#x2019;re planning to go home for the summer,&#x201d; the principal said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sources?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;What sources?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, the usual. I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;re aware that we keep close tabs on our student body here. Listening devices, phone taps, that sort of thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>I hadn&#x2019;t been aware of this at all. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re tapping my phone?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s standard procedure. We must keep our guard up at all times. As you know, we&#x2019;ve had some trouble with double agents here at the academy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Uh, yes. I was the one who caught the double agent,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t really think I&#x2019;d work for the enemy after that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They did offer you a job.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Which I turned down. Right before helping defuse a bomb that would have wiped out the heads of every spy organization in the country.&#x201d;<br> <br>The principal shrugged, unimpressed. &#x201c;One can never be too cautious,&#x201d; he said. He then leafed through a thick report on his desk. It appeared to contain several transcripts of my private phone calls. &#x201c;According to this, you intend to spend the summer at the home of your parents and hang out at some place called FunLand with a Mike Brezinski?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s correct,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;Y&#x2019;know, you could have just asked me what I was doing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How did you plan on getting away with this?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Getting away with what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Avoiding summer school.&#x201d;<br> <br>I suddenly felt queasy, which happened all too often at spy school. &#x201c;The academy has summer school?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course. Evil doesn&#x2019;t take holidays. Why should we?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No one ever told me there was summer school,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be ridiculous. Every new recruit is informed about mandatory summer education during the very first assembly of the school year.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t at the first assembly of the school year,&#x201d; I reminded the principal. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t recruit me until last January.&#x201d;<br> <br>The principal stared at me blankly for a moment. It was his standard look when he realized that someone had screwed up royally&#x2014;and it was probably him. I&#x2019;d seen this expression quite a lot in my five months at spy school. The principal ultimately recovered with his standard response to his screwups: blaming the person who&#x2019;d been screwed. &#x201c;Well, you should have figured it out anyhow,&#x201d; he told me. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re studying to be a spy, for Pete&#x2019;s sake. It&#x2019;s not like the school&#x2019;s existence is a secret.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The school&#x2019;s existence is a secret,&#x201d; I countered.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve had enough of your lip!&#x201d; the principal snapped. &#x201c;Would you like to begin summer school on probation?&#x201d;<br> <br>I shook my head, then realized something. &#x201c;All the other students have been packing their things. Aren&#x2019;t they attending summer school too?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Absolutely. Everyone at the academy is required to attend summer courses. They&#x2019;re just not taught here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then where are they taught?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;At our wilderness education facility.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Wilderness education?&#x201d; I repeated.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; the principal said. &#x201c;During the summer months, we shift from classroom subjects to focus more on physical training and outdoor survival schools. After all, ninety-nine percent of the world is outdoors. A good spy needs to know how to get along there.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it&#x2019;s kind of like spy camp.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not camp!&#x201d; the principal shouted. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s an elite wilderness survival training facility. It merely happens to look like a camp. And as far as your family, friends, or anyone else knows, you will be attending a camp. The Happy Trails Sleepaway Camp for Boys and Girls.&#x201d; The principal rooted around in his desk drawer until he found a document, which he then slid across the desk to me.<br> <br>It was a single page with the address of the point in Washington, DC, where I would meet the official academy vehicle for transportation to the camp, and a list of survival supplies to bring. At the bottom, as with all documentation at spy school, there was a directive to memorize the contents and then destroy it.<br> <br>&#x201c;When does it start?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;In three days,&#x201d; the principal replied. &#x201c;Go home and have a nice weekend with your family. But don&#x2019;t tell anyone about the true nature of this camp&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Or you&#x2019;ll have to kill me,&#x201d; I finished. I knew the routine.<br> <br>&#x201c;Exactly. We&#x2019;ll see you on Monday at oh nine hundred hours sharp.&#x201d; The principal returned to his top secret documents, as though I had suddenly ceased to exist. Our meeting was over.<br> <br>I let myself out of his office and headed back to my room.<br> <br>My immediate reaction to the news that I had mandatory summer school was annoyance and frustration. I&#x2019;d been working hard for the past five months and I missed my family and friends; I felt I deserved a few weeks off from my studies. But as I crossed campus, my mood began to change. While my first few weeks at spy school had been difficult&#x2014;I&#x2019;d nearly been assassinated, kidnapped, and blown up&#x2014;things had got much better after people had stopped trying to kill me. I had come to enjoy school and had made a lot of friends. In fact, for the first time in my life, I was regarded as somewhat cool; preventing the destruction of your school and capturing the agent responsible is a great boon to your social life. Meanwhile, back home, my spy student identity was still a secret. Everyone thought I was attending some lame science school. I&#x2019;d probably be even less popular than I had been before I&#x2019;d left. Thus, the idea of spending more time with my fellow spies-to-be wasn&#x2019;t so bad. And the fact that I&#x2019;d be doing it outdoors, rather than cooped up inside dingy old classrooms, made it sound even better.<br> <br>By the time I got back to my dorm room, I was thinking a summer at spy camp might be kind of fun.<br> <br>And then I found the second letter.<br> <br>It was exactly where the first one had been, perched atop all my suitcases. Even though I&#x2019;d locked the door to my room before going to see the principal.<br> <br>Hey Ben!<br> <br>Just wanted you to know we&#x2019;ll be coming for you soon.<br> <br>Your pals at SPYDER<br> <br>I sat on my bed, feeling as though the wind had been knocked out of me.<br> <br>SPYDER was the evil organization that had planted a mole in the school, sent an assassin to my room, and tried to take out every leader in the intelligence community with a bomb. I hadn&#x2019;t heard a thing from them since helping to defeat their nefarious plans.<br> <br>Maybe this summer wasn&#x2019;t going to be so much fun after all.</p><h2>The Storyteller&#39;s Secret: From TED Speakers to Business Legends, Why Some Ideas Catch On and Others Don&#39;t</h2><p><p>How did an American immigrant without a college education go from Venice Beach T-Shirt vendor to television&#x2019;s most successful producer?

Like the Runes, Tarot and <i>I Ching</i>, it is also used in divination, as an oracle which can teach us much about our fate and future. Unlike Tarot, whose cards depict a set of characters and situations, Ogam's twenty "tree Letters" are all named after woodland tress. You might well ask how trees can function as an oracle system, as a set of signs, omens and auguries. The fact is that each tree in the Tree Alphabet has a set of correspondences and meanings attached to it All the tree-letters are linked to figures or themes from Celtic mythology, and each has a unique wisdom to impart. Once they become familiar to you, you will find that the ancient tree-letters relate to your own particular circumstances, providing profound guidance and counsel.</p><h2>101 Power Crystals: The Ultimate Guide to Magical Crystals, Gems, and Stones for Healing and Transformation</h2><p><p>The definitive resource for working with powerful crystals!

In Mesopotamia, Agates were engraved as seal stones (symbols of power and authority). Pliny wrote that the Romans used the stone to make mortar and pestles with which to grind medicines.</p><p>Agate supports life in difficult circumstances, keeping the soul from harm. Legend said that eagles carried Agates to their nests to protect their young from snakebites, so early people wore Agate amulets to guard against the venomous bites of spiders or scorpions. In China, Agate was believed to be the solidified blood of the ancestors. In India and North Africa, red Agates were thought to contain the blood of demons and thus afforded protection against evil spirits.</p><p>Agate is associated with Archangel Michael and the Shekinah, the divine feminine and merciful Queen of Heaven who rules karmic release, wholeness, and blessings. Almost certainly in the biblical Breastplate of the High Priest, Agate would have been the eighth stone, connecting it to Scorpio.</p><p><b>Healing Power</b></p><p>Travelers in the Arabian and African deserts sucked Agates to overcome the effects of thirst. In the Middle Ages, the stones were used to heal dropsy and fever, relieve insomnia, firm the gums, and prevent epilepsy in children. Today, crystal workers harness Agate&#x2019;s power to bring stability to the physical body and aura, cleanse the lymphatic system, and regulate fluid balance. The stone assists emotional healing and strengthens mental concentration.</p><p><b>Transformational Power</b></p><p>Agate puts you in touch with your inner self. Its power lies in its ability to transmute dark, toxic emotions such as jealousy, bitterness, and resentment, which have a psychosomatic effect on the body, creating disease in the heart and unrest in the soul. Due to its powerful cleansing effect, Agate helps you assimilate challenging life experiences and recognize the spiritual gifts they offer. By promoting self-acceptance and forgiveness, Agate increases receptivity to spiritual currents in your life. Carrying an Agate stimulates courage to start again and encourages you to hold fast to your own truth. It helps you recognize your eternal nature and the oneness of all things.</p><p>Although some Agates feature brilliant colors, these effects are created by humans, not nature. The raw stones are heated with minerals, such as iron, to turn dull slices of rock into rainbows of color. Agate reminds us that no matter how base the material we start with, it can be tempered and transformed by spiritual alchemy.</p></p><h2>Beginner&#39;s Guide to Linocut</h2><p><b>Learn to create beautiful and practical linocut prints at home with this contemporary guide to a well-loved traditional art form.</b><br><br>Linocut and screenprinting have undergone a resurgence in recent years; this book teaches the basic techniques for learning to make your own prints at home, under the guidance and tutelage of expert teacher and artist Susan Yeates.<br><br>Susan, who runs her own print business, Magenta Sky, explains the rudiments of linocutting, and guides the reader through ten practical and attainable projects including creating gift cards, artworks to frame and bags or tea towels to print and give as personalized presents.</p><p>Susan Yeates is a printmaker, tutor and published author.

Alan Branch takes a fair, respectful, and factual tone in addressing this complex issue through a biblical lens. You'll learn: <br><ul><li>Scientific research around the transgender experience</li><li>An Overview of the history of transgenderism</li><li>Important terminology surrounding gender issues</li><li>Why people pursue gender reassignment surgery, and what happens after</li><li>How to navigate conversations around this topic</li><br><br></ul>The book ends with two practical chapters for families and churches, giving you guiding principles for how to address this issue in a loving, Christ--honoring way.<br><br>The first step to responding well to any situation is understanding it. <i>Affirming God's Image</i> equips you with the biblical, scientific, and practical knowledge you need for a wise response.</p><p><b>J. Alan Branch</b> is professor of Christian ethics at Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Kansas City, MO. He has also served as a pastor and a chaplain in the U.S. Army Reserves. He is the author of <i>Born This Way? Homosexuality, Science, and the Scriptures</i>.<p>Affirming God&#x2019;s Image is the book I will recommend first to anyone with concerns about transgenderism. Professor Branch has made a thorough study of the exegetical and medical literature on the subject, and he presents judicious analysis and evaluation of it. Most important, he understands deeply what Scripture says about human sexuality. He urges us to show the love of Christ to people afflicted by gender dysphoria (especially including our own children and youth). But he sees great dangers in gender reassignment surgery and urges a vigorous &#x201c;no&#x201d; when that is suggested. He calls us to affirm the sex God has given to us at birth as a precious gift. And he presents these messages to us clearly and with grace. &#x2015;John M. Frame, retired J. D. Trimble Chair of Systematic Theology and Philosophy, Reformed Theological Seminary (Orlando)</p><br><br><p>Careful, compassionate, and faithful, this new volume from Alan Branch is required reading for pastors, counselors, families, and individuals who are struggling with gender dysphoria. Dr. Branch has waded through a sea of literature to distill an approach that calls on Christians to love those who are suffering and to serve them by sharing biblical truth about sexuality. &#x2015;C. Ben Mitchell, Graves Professor of Moral Philosophy, Union University</p><br><br><p>Affirming God&#x2019;s Image by Alan Branch is a timely and welcome resource for Christians needing to understand the transgenderism movement sweeping Western culture in opposition to the timeless Word of God. It is written in terms easy to comprehend but with a thoroughness deserving academic respect. Branch argues transgenderism is not a genetic or neurological trait, is a constructed social identity rooted in many causes, and is entirely contrary to biblical truth making it impossible to reconcile with reliable Christian ethics. I recommend this book with eager enthusiasm and am sure it will be a standard on the subject for years to come. &#x2015;Daniel R. Heimbach, Senior Professor of Christian Ethics, Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary</p></p><h2>Bleach, Vol. 9</h2><p>Ichigo Kurosaki never asked for the ability to see ghosts - he was born with the gift.

Native German speakers acquire their knowledge of the grammatical gender of German nouns from early on. They are not given formal instruction at school about matching nouns to their correct gender, and the topic is not covered in standard German grammar books. For the same reason, native speakers who give German language lessons to foreigners do not teach their students how to match nouns to their gender: One cannot teach what one has not been taught.This book fills that gap in that it explains, in plain English, the principles that map German nouns to a specific gender. This allows foreign students of German to unlock the gender of entire categories of nouns, thereby enabling students to speak German more confidently.</p><p>Constantin Vayenas has applied a computer analysis to map patterns between German nouns and their gender. Combined with his knowledge of Greek and Latin, he unlocks the principles governing the allocation of gender to German nouns.</p><h2>Star Wars: The Ultimate Action Figure Collection (Star Wars x Chronicle Books)</h2><p>Here at last is the complete and definitive collection of the more than 2,500 <em>Star Wars</em>� action figures produced over the last 35 years.

Looking at three ancient texts, she explores the historic background and theological and cultural questions that the documents raise. <p>"<i>The Gospel of Mary</i>" is a humbly told story of the Virgin's life from her conception to the birth of Jesus, put into written form as early as A.D. 150. The second text is a brief prayer to Mary found in Egypt on a scrap of papyrus and dated to the following century. It is the oldest known prayer to Mary. The third text, "The Annunciation Hymn of Rejoicing," was written by the Syrian poet Romanos in about A.D. 520 and is considered one of the finest examples of Eastern Christian poetry.

Have you thought about what this practice means and where it came from? It's not something that was picked up from the surrounding culture. Instead, it comes directly from 1 Corinthians 11 (in the Bible) where this practice is explained in surprising depth. In fifteen consecutive verses, the Apostle Paul explains and defends the practice of head covering. He appeals to apostolic tradition, to the created roles of men and women, to angels, to nature, and to the church's exclusive position on this topic. <br><br> Though head covering was practiced by the majority of Christians throughout Church history, it is now practiced only by a small minority. However, today many Christians are rediscovering this ancient practice, fueling a resurgence of head covering during church gatherings. <br><br> From the founder of the <i>Head Covering Movement</i> comes "Head Covering: A Forgotten Christian Practice for Modern Times." In this book, Jeremy Gardiner will walk you through the Scriptures so you will see how this symbol beautifully depicts the created differences between men and women. You'll hear the history of head covering, showing that it wasn't until the feminist revolution that this practice fell out of favor in the Western church. The most popular objections (the cultural view, the long hair view, and charges of legalism) are all answered in-depth. Finally, the book addresses practical questions regarding how this is to be carried out. <br><br> For too long, head covering has been neglected and stereotyped. Unfair associations with cults, legalism, unsophisticated theology, and frumpiness have turned many people off. We want to move past these stereotypes and into Scripture&#x2014;because contrary to those views, head covering is biblical, beautiful, and relevant. This is not some new strange doctrine. This is a practice with an early and long history that is firmly based in the Bible. The rejection of this symbol is new, setting modern generations apart from the majority of believers throughout Church history. It&#x2019;s time we changed that. <br><br> <b>Endorsements</b> <br><br> Jeremy Gardiner has written a thoughtful and helpful argument from Scripture and church history for women to cover their heads in worship.

The result is this socio-psycho-cultural analysis informed by economic theory.Mises explores answers from a wide variety of angles, and discusses the nature of academic institutions, popular culture, and how vices like jealousy and envy affect theory. All play a role in preventing people from seeing the self-evident benefits of economic freedom relative to controls. His comments on the resentment of the intellectuals cut very deeply. Mises shrewdly teases the anti-capitalist bias out of contemporary fiction and popular culture generally.In the course of his narrative, he explains aspects of the market that have generally eluded even its defenders. For example, is it true that markets dumb down the culture, exalting trashy novels and movies over higher-brow fare? Mises points out that the tastes of the masses will always and everywhere be lower than those educated and cultivated to love higher culture. But, he says, the glory of capitalism is that it brings to every sector what it wants and needs, and more of it than any other system. So, yes, there will be more trash, but also more great work as well. It is a matter of availability: Under socialism, nothing is available. Under capitalism, choice seems nearly infinite.His is quite subtle in his analysis here and throughout. It&#39;s remarkable how his narrative applies in our time, even more than when it was written.The style of this volume is more casual than you will find elsewhere. In some sense, it is more thrilling for it. The reader senses that Mises has unleashed a lifetime of frustration here, and shined a very bright light on some dark corners of opinion.The contents of this volume include:I.

Weber Series in the New Borderlands History)</h2><p>By the late 1810s, a global revolution in cotton had remade the U.S.-Mexico border, bringing wealth and waves of Americans to the Gulf Coast while also devastating the lives and villages of Mexicans in Texas. In response, Mexico threw open its northern territories to American farmers in hopes that cotton could bring prosperity to the region. Thousands of Anglo-Americans poured into Texas, but their insistence that slavery accompany them sparked pitched battles across Mexico. An extraordinary alliance of Anglos and Mexicans in Texas came together to defend slavery against abolitionists in the Mexican government, beginning a series of fights that culminated in the Texas Revolution. In the aftermath, Anglo-Americans rebuilt the Texas borderlands into the most unlikely creation: the first fully committed slaveholders' republic in North America. <br><br><i>Seeds of Empire</i> tells the remarkable story of how the cotton revolution of the early nineteenth century transformed northeastern Mexico into the western edge of the United States, and how the rise and spectacular collapse of the Republic of Texas as a nation built on cotton and slavery proved to be a blueprint for the Confederacy of the 1860s.<br><br></p><p>Andrew J. Torget is assistant professor of history at the University of North Texas.Written in a clear, engaging style, and supported by prodigious research in both Mexican and U.S. archives, <i>Seeds of Empire</i> offers a complete reconfiguration of this period of Texas history.&nbsp; It will undoubtedly serve as the standard work on the topic.--<i>American Historical Review</i><br>[An] insightful volume [that] provides a new analysis focused on the development of cotton farming.--<i>Southwestern Historical Quarterly</i><br>Incisive and accessible . . . bridges borderlands history with that of the Atlantic World, crafting a multifaceted view of the rise of 'King Cotton' across borders and oceans.--<i>Choice</i><br>A well-argued, brisk survey of the formative decades of modern Texas that challenges us to reconsider why it is that the legacy of slavery continues to haunt our civic and cultural life, both in Texas and throughout the nation.--<i>Western Historical Quarterly</i><br>Torget ultimately has crafted a work to which scholars of the U.S.-Mexico borderlands should aspire--one that effectively balances U.S. and Mexican sources and addresses vital historical issues resonating from shifting national and imperial spaces.--<i>Journal of American History</i><br>Well written, expertly researched, and interpretatively ambitious, <i>Seeds of Empire</i> immediately moves to the front ranks of monographs examining the long Civil War era on both sides of the Rio Grande.--<i>Journal of the Civil War Era</i><br>Deeply researched and clearly written.--<i>Journal of Southern History</i><br>The most nuanced and authoritative rewriting of Texas's origin myth to date.--<i>Texas Monthly</i><br>Deeply researched and artfully written . . . <i>Seeds of Empire</i> brings new insight and nuance to the story of early Texas. . . .

He has illustrated more than 150 books and has twice received the New York Times Best Illustrated Books award. Michael lives in western Massachusetts.</p>McCurdy (The Old Man and the Fiddle, 1992, etc.) switches from his familiar woodcut style to realistic paintings of landscapes, ice, and ocean in a retelling of Sir Ernest Shackleton's famous expedition. It was 1915 when, during Shackleton's attempt to cross the polar ice cap, the Endurance became trapped in ice, soon to be crushed and sunk. McCurdy covers the desperate problems faced by the crew: how to survive without the ship; how to find food while they waited for open water; how they saved a sleeping crewman when their solid perch cracked in two during the night. Frightening voyages in lifeboats and a near-impossible climb on a snow-covered mountain are part of the story; a party of three makes it to a whaling station on South Georgia Island, and no men are lost. The telling is clear and laced with excellent detail, but the picture-book format is less than ideal, requiring an author's note, foreword, and afterword for many of the details; further, the older audience for which the material has the most appeal may be uncomfortable with the format. Although McCurdy's galvanizing enthusiasm comes across on every page, the pictures- -and the bleak, unchanging landscape--don't communicate the cold nor the toll that time and the elements took on the men's clothing and faces. Still, aspects of this are riveting, and it will certainly lead readers into longer, more detailed accounts of this two-year expedition.

This book will transform your world view. Dr. Masaru Emoto&#x2019;s first book, The Hidden Message in Water, told about his discovery that crystals formed in frozen water revealed changes when specific, concentrated thoughts were directed toward them. He also found that water from clear springs and water that has been exposed to loving words showed brilliant, complex and colourful snowflake patters. In contrast, polluted water, or water exposed to negative though formed incomplete, asymmetrical patterns with dull colors. The implications of this research creates a new awareness of how we can positively impact the Earth and our own personal world. This book takes you further and deeper into how you can affect your own personal healing by reading it.</p><p>Dr. Masaru Emoto is a renowned Japanese scientist and a graduate of Yokohama International University as a doctor of alternative medicine.

Now, at last, don Juan returns in <i>The Power of Silence</i>&#x2014;wise, infuriating, capable or working miracles and playing practical jokes, but always seeking the wisdom of the warrior.<br><br><i>The Power of Silence</i> is Castaneda's most astonishing book to date -- a brilliant flash of knowledge that illuminates the far reaches of the human mind. Through don Juan's mesmerizing stories, the true meaning of sorcery and magic is finally revealed. Honed in the desert of Sonora, the visions of don Juan give us the vital secrets of belief and self-realization that are transcendental and valid for us all. It is Castaneda's unique genius to show us that all wisdom, strength, and power lie within ourselves -- unleashed with marvelous energy and imaginative force in the teachings of don Juan -- and in the writings of his famous pupil, Carlos Castaneda</p><p>Born in 1925 in Peru, anthropologist <b>Carlos Castaneda</b> wrote a total of 15 books, which sold 8 million copies worldwide and were published in 17 different languages. In his writing, Castaneda describes the teaching of Don Juan, a Yaqui sorcerer and shaman. His works helped define the 1960's and usher in the New Age movement. Even after his mysterious death in California in1998, his books continue to inspire and influence his many devoted fans.In this new work, Don Juanabsent from Castaneda's preceding three worksonce again appears prominently. To convey the advanced spirituality of the Yaqui shaman, Castaneda relates stories told by Don Juan and his own experiences with the don. Such mysterious concepts as "stalking" and "intent," the "knocking" and trickery of the spirit, are all discussed. The vivid depictions of Don Juan's powers and personality will reawaken readers' fascination with earlier volumes, and since only one of three sets of six stories supposedly related by Don Juan appears here, doubtless more books are to come.

She pushed the dark, ominous feeling aside and made believe that it was her abhorrence for surprise parties that brought on this edginess. She held the grocery bag that Sable had given her and stood, obediently, on the walk leading to Gabby's front door.<br><br>This was Sable's idea-the surprise birthday party for Gabby's fiftieth birthday. It was April sixteenth, the day after taxes were due. Gabby was an Aries, but lacked many of the typical character flaws of the astrological sign. She was neither arrogant, nor selfish, nor controlling. She possessed a raw courage, and she had a rare zest for life. Gabby turned fifty today-a beautiful, vibrant, exciting fifty. Fifty on the brink of still greater things, not on the declining side of life. Elly, fifty-eight, had not had such youth or vibrancy at twenty.<br><br>Something was wrong.<br><br>Elly heard the ticktocking of Sable's heels on the flagstone walk. She, too, carried a grocery bag. There were two more bags in the trunk, all filled with the makings of a lavish champagne brunch. The idea was to arrive just prior to Gabby's waking hour-somewhere around 11:00 a.m. It was ten-thirty. They hadn't even considered coming earlier. Gabby, for all her joy of life, was as mean as a junkyard dog in the early morning.<br><br>"Don't get Daisy barking," Sable commanded in a whisper, though they stood several feet from the front door. "We don't want Gabby to know what's up until the others arrive." The others were Barbara Ann Vaughan and Beth Mahoney. The five of them formed an intimate little writers' group who relied on each other for support, critique, industry news, celebration and whatever the publishing industry threw at them. Their works were diverse, ranging from mystery to romance to academic. Gabby's house was where they always met.<br><br>Daisy. <em>That</em> was the trouble, Elly realized. Gabby's nine-year-old golden retriever was whining at the door. Not much more than a miserable squeak. Added was the occasional scrape of her heavy paw; she wanted out. This was not typical. If Daisy heard people outside the door, she usually got all excited. She'd woof politely, but loudly.<br><br>"Listen," Elly ordered. "That's Daisy. She's not barking."<br><br>"She probably knows it's us," Sable suggested.<br><br>Elly put her bag down on the walk and crept nearer the door. Daisy had known them all since puppyhood and it had never stopped her from barking before. She was <em>crying!</em><br><br>"Eleanor!" Sable whispered furiously. She rushed up behind Elly, snatching at her sleeve. "Come away from that door! You're going to spoil it!"<br><br>"Something's wrong," Elly said loudly, punching the doorbell.<br><br>"What the hell are you doing?"<br><br>The dog still had not started barking. "Listen," Elly said. "Hear anything?"<br><br>"Not yet, but any second we're going to hear Gabby cursing on her way to the-"<br><br>"Daisy <em>still</em> isn't barking. Listen to her fuss. Something's wrong." Eleanor began digging through her enormous shoulder bag for her keys. She was the only one among the women who had a key to Gabby's house, given to her years ago so she could check on things while Gabby was out of town. She'd had it ever since, but never had an occasion like this in which to use it.<br><br>"Eleanor," Sable groaned. "Shit. You're going to ruin everything. What do you think you're doing?"<br><br>Elly rang the bell a couple more times, but didn't wait for a response. She slid the appropriate key into the lock. Daisy came bounding through the door, rushing past the two of them, not looking back. Out into the freedom. Out onto the grass. She looked back over her shoulder guiltily as she squatted to pee not three feet from the front walk. She'd been ready to explode, obviously.<br><br>"Jesus," Sable muttered.<br><br>"Gabby?" Eleanor called into the house. "Gabrielle?<br><br>Gabby?"<br><br>"She's probably still asleep," Sable said, but she said so hopefully. "Slept through the doorbell and the yelling. Just like her. She sleeps like the-" Sable stopped herself.<br><br>Elly frowned over her shoulder briefly, then walked into the house ahead of Sable. Daisy bounded past them again, in the other direction, into the house. The sound of talking could be heard inside-television talking.<br><br>Elly called out a couple more times, but softly, suspiciously.<br><br>They found her in the family room. She was lying on the couch, eyes closed. One foot was on the floor and she had a sheaf of papers on her lap. Probably manuscript pages. From a distance of three feet she could be mistaken for a sleeping girl; she was slight of build, fair complected and had hardly any gray streaking her curly, honey-blond hair. On the sofa table beside her was a can of diet soda, a glass of water and a bottle of aspirin. By the time they got there Daisy had taken her place again beside the couch, guarding. She looked up at them mournfully, as though she knew.<br><br>Eleanor gasped and rushed to Gabby's side, her large purse slipping off her shoulder and crashing to the floor as she knelt. She frantically touched Gabby's brow. Sable's hand rose to cover her mouth, her eyes disbelieving and her head already shaking denial. Eleanor touched Gabby's cheeks, her neck, her hands, muttering over and over, <em>My God My God My God,</em> then, <em>Oh No Oh No No No,</em> while Sable, stunned and terrified, stood frozen, not breathing. Elly stopped touching Gabby after a few seconds and straightened herself stoically. She turned toward Sable as rigidly as a soldier. "She's dead, Sable. She's been dead for some time."<br><br>"No," Sable whispered.<br><br>Elly nodded, frowning, because by then she had noticed there was a smell of some kind. Eleanor had talked to Gabby the previous afternoon; it wasn't as though she'd begun to decompose. There were no visible signs of blood, bruises or marks. It was the smell of death and it's accompanying atrocities.<br><br>"Go back outside," Elly said calmly. "Wait for Barbara and Beth. Don't let them come in. I'm going to have to call the police."<br><br>"The police?"<br><br>"It wasn't old age, Sable," Eleanor said, her voice cracking. "What would you suggest?"<br><br>Sable's eyes had taken on a stricken, panicked gleam. She hugged herself to keep from shaking or being sick. Not sick with disgust, but sick with horror. Her dearest friend. Dead before her very eyes. Sable couldn't answer. Her face went white.<br><br>"Don't fall apart on me now," Eleanor instructed calmly but firmly. "Just don't. Hang on for a while. I'll join you outside in a minute. Now go."<br><br>Eleanor walked into the kitchen and picked up the cordless. She dialed 911. She figured whatever had killed Gabby hadn't been homicidal...and even if it had been, it was safe to use the phone. She didn't care very much about fingerprints and all that. The cause of death, she had already decided, hadn't been murder, but rather theft. Elly's dearest treasure had just been stolen. "Yes, ah, my name is Eleanor Fulton and I've just let myself into my friend's house to find that she's...she's...expired. <em>Expired,</em> I said. Dead. Dead for some time, I guess. She's very cold and white. I think it must have been natural-a heart attack perhaps. What I mean is, there doesn't seem to be any...any <em>sign</em> of anything. No, no, she's only fifty." She did not add "today." She noticed that the message light on Gabby's answering machine was blinking madly, something that would no doubt help the police determine how long her dearest friend had been gone. She wanted to play the messages, to hear what final words had been spoken to Gabby while she lay on the sofa, dying to late-night TV. Birthday well-wishers? Instead, she gave the police dispatcher the address and asked that there please be no sirens. This was all bad enough without flashing lights and sirens.<br><br>When she replaced the receiver she realized her hand was shaking almost violently. She tucked it under her arm like an annoying old sock and took a deep breath. She would have to call Don, Gabby's ex-husband, but she'd wait until after the police had come to the house. She might even be the one to tell the children-David and Sarah-but not without Don. She would see to that. Don would manage, somehow, to be civil to his children, or Elly might physically make her point about it. Maybe just coldcock him, something she'd had an impulse to do for years now. Gabby was much more forgiving than Eleanor.<br><br>But before she would let herself enjoy the prospect of decking Don, she went back to Gabby. She stared down at her. Over twenty years, she thought in desolation. They were young together, even though Elly felt she, herself, had never been young. They had survived things that should have killed them. The others-Sable, Barbara and Beth-might love Gabby equally, but they hadn't had her quite as long. Hadn't been through quite as much with her.<br><br>Eleanor picked up her heavy purse and looped the strap over her shoulder before she dug inside for a handkerchief. She felt her eyes and nose drip before she was even aware she was crying, and she sopped up her leaking pain as best she could, dipping the linen under her glasses.<br><br>Gabby didn't look particularly peaceful to her, or maybe that was just her own emotions projected. Was that a slight frown? Had Gabby's face recently taken on those lines without Eleanor noticing? It was lividity, she finally realized, the color drained from Gabby's face, her lips falling slack and drying out. It was outrageous that Gabby be the first to go; she was the youngest at heart of them all. Everyone depended on her to a fault. Her children still needed her desperately, and Don, divorced from her for over fifteen years, relied on her constantly. And God, not even Gabby knew how Elly needed her. Maybe we wore her out, Elly thought. But no. Gabby had never seemed worn. Nor even tired. Never.<br><br>"Goddamnit," she whispered to Gabby. "I wasn't done with you yet."<br><br>A prominent character trait of Eleanor's was her complete lack of sentiment. She was rarely emotional, and if she was, it was usually about something political or intellectual. It was one of the things that made her an exceptional book critic. Finding Gabby, however, made her feel twenty years older and as vulnerable as a prepubescent girl all at once. She didn't actually cry so much as her eyes kept leaking and dripping beyond her control. Her voice remained steady and her words precisely clipped, but everything inside her quivered. She'd never felt so weak.<br><br>She stooped, hunched, as she walked out of Gabby's house. Her legs and arms were heavy and aching. Her stomach, a problem anyway, was twisted around. Being the eldest, the one who had known Gabby longest, she would be expected to take control of this situation. To know what to do. It was doubtful, she thought.<br><br>The first thing she saw was Beth Mahoney being comforted by Sable. They sat on the edge of the planter box in Gabby's front yard. Beth was the youngest of their group, girlish for her thirty-two years. She leaned her elbows on her knees and wept into her hands, the sound of her crying like distant bird-chirping. Sable was turned in Beth's direction, one of her hands gently rubbing the young woman's back while she patted her knee with the other.<br><br>Sable turned instinctively toward Elly and stood to look her over. With great relief Elly could see that Sable had composed herself on cue. It was no wonder. Sable had taught herself this trick years ago. Who knew how she was falling apart inside, how she'd fall apart later, when she was alone? If there was a vulnerable side to Sable, she kept it private. But for now, while Elly visibly sagged, Sable stood erect and assisted her toward that same planter box like she was the little old lady she felt she'd suddenly become.<br><br>"You'd better sit down," Sable instructed. "You're white as a sheet. You're wobbling. You're-"<br><br>"Please, that will do," Eleanor said, but her usual bark was barely a growl.<br><br>"Do you need a glass of water or anything?"<br><br>"No. No. I'll be all right in a minute. What have you told Dorothy?"<br><br>"To stay in the car," Sable said simply. Dorothy was Sable's housekeeper and cook. Part of the birthday surprise was to be Dorothy's preparation of brunch followed by a thorough cleaning of Gabby's house. Housekeeping was not Gabby's forte. And Dorothy would get a handsome bonus from Sable for the day's work. "Look at her," Sable said in a low, irritated voice.<br><br>Eleanor had to once again wipe the liquid from her eyes and blink to clear her vision. Dorothy sat in the backseat of Sable's Mercedes. She stared straight ahead, her hands poised atop the purse she held in her lap. She had tightly curled silver hair, a sharp nose and no chin. "Did you tell her what we found?" Elly asked.<br><br>"No."<br><br>And the sight of women weeping on the planter box had not moved her to ask if anything was wrong? Would the arrival of the police and coroner cause her to turn her head? Sable had long referred to Dorothy as the kitchen witch.<br><br>"I should have learned by now, you never exaggerate," Elly said.<br><br>A horrible insult of putts, grinding gears and angry growls caused all three women to look down the street. A partially sanded 1967 Camaro jerked noisily toward them. Barbara Ann Vaughan had a frazzled, tense look of concentration as she edged the car, gears sticking, to park behind Beth's late-model Ford. Once there, the car died. But it got real sick first, coughing and choking. Barbara actually had a car of her own, a nice, fairly new one that she rarely drove. Someone else in her household always needed a better car and it was anyone's guess what that would leave her to drive. Her sons were aged sixteen, seventeen, nineteen and twenty-one. They would not leave home while the food held out.<br><br>She had to reach outside the car to open the door and let herself out. She gripped a screwdriver that had some function to driving, pitched it back into the car and took a few seconds to gather up purse, gift and some papers. She kicked the door closed with her foot and called the car "you piece of shit" while her friends looked on. Barbara didn't immediately see that anything was wrong; she was preoccupied with her own ever-present set of problems. Plus, this was approximately the scene she expected-Sable, Beth and Elly waiting outside while the cleaning lady, who wouldn't be expected to yell "surprise," sat in the car.<br><br></p><h2>The Monster War: A League of Seven Novel (The League of Seven, 3)</h2><p><p><b><i>The Monster War</i> is the third book in the action-packed, steampunk League of Seven series by acclaimed author Alan Gratz. </b></p><p>Having discovered the monstrous secret of his origins, Archie Dent is no longer certain that he is worthy to be a member of the League of Seven.

Instead of clinging to grace, we strive for good and believe that the Christian life means hard work and a sweet disposition. As good girls, we focus on the things we can handle, our disciplined lives, and our unshakable good moods. When we fail to measure up to our own impossible standards, we hide behind our good girl masks, determined to keep our weakness a secret.<br><br>In <i>Grace for the Good Girl</i>, Emily Freeman invites women to let go of the try-hard life and realize that in Christ we are free to receive from him rather than constantly try to achieve for him.

We tend to focus only on the things we can handle, our disciplined lives, and our <i>unshakable</i> good moods. <br><br>But what would happen if we let grace pour out boundless acceptance into our worn-out hearts and undo us? If we dared to talk about the ways we hide, our longing to be known, and the fear in the knowing? <br><br>In <i>Grace for the Good Girl</i>, Emily Freeman invites you to release your tight hold on that familiar, try-hard life and lean your weight heavy into the love of Jesus.

This fantastic book is all you need if you want to start drawing the figure, or if you want to develop your life drawing skills. It is the ultimate reference book, a most inspirational guide and above all it offers everything you ever needed to know, including tips on simple ways to get it right, essential advice on anatomy, help with easy drawing methods and many different examples of the drawn figure. It is important to understand how the body works and detailed sections show hands, feet, faces, limbs and much more.</p><p>Gottfried Bammes, born in 1920 in Freital, Germany, worked as an art teacher at the College of Fine Arts in Dresden. Bammes was a prolific writer and artist, was considered to be a master of life drawing and anatomy,and produced numerous books on the subject in his lifetime. In 1974 he was awarded the National Prize of the German Democratic Republic for Science and Technology and received the Culture and Art Prize of the City of Freital in 2000. He died in 2007.A lot of things claim to be the complete guide but, at a whopping 312 pages, this one certainly looks and feels the part. Getting inside it confirmd that this is indeed a substantial work, with every aspect of the human form examined from block shapes through muscle and bone structure to the completed artwork. Each section follows the same progression, so it becomes easy to follow which, given how much there is to absorb, is a definite plus. Because there&#39;s so much, though, you need to be aware that this is something to sit down and take time with, rather than dip into. Think of it as a structured course and you won&#39;t go far wrong with it. Gottfried covers male and female figures, both static and in motion and in a variety of poses, as you&#39;d probably expect from a book of this kind. He also deals in the same detail with eyes and ears as he does with bodies and legs, so there&#39;s literally no stone unturned. If you can&#39;t get a private tutor, this is very much the next best thing. It&#39;s structured very much like a course and is absolutely thorough in its attention to detail and should satisfy the most demanding student.-Artbookreview.net This one of the most thorough and exhaustive guides to figure drawing I have ever seen and certainly lives up to the claim inherent in its title. Progress is steady and logical, starting with the basic shapes of male and female figures, adults and children, and moving on to how they appear both stationary and in motion, before progressing to the various body parts and, eventually, how everything fits together. All the sections follow the same pattern, moving from basic form and structure to musculature, followed by a series of exercises and examples. As a result, the book becomes easy to follow and it&#39;s definitely the intention that the reader should work through it as a formal course. This is a substantial book and its length betokens the thoroughness of the author&#39;s approach, which is about the nearest thing you can get, in a book, to face-to-face teaching.(Henry Malt)-The Artist Learn to draw the human figure from scratch without having to persuade anybody to take off their clothes! Of course there is no substitute for a real teacher and real flesh-and-blood models but if these are lacking a book like this is surely the next best thing - This is a large book with over three hundred pages and it covers a lot of ground. You can learn to draw people of every age in here, starting with learning about the basic proportions and progressing through motion studies, individual body parts and keeping a sketchbook. The tasks to complete are many, and they start off very simply indeed with basic exercises, many of which are quick to complete but which build up an impressive body of knowledge. Get to grips with proportions using strips of paper, learn about the relationship between one limb and another, practise brush strokes, go out and observe people and many more. The book is profusely illustrated not only with work by this artist but with many sketches from old masters and others from the Renaissance to the present day. There are drawings showing muscles, bones and other anatomical details and naming them, so the student gets a good look at the underpinnings of the human body and how it moves. After trying out a few exercises I was impressed at how much I was learning, so if you want to master drawing and painting the human body then this is a good book to get.-Myshelf.com This practical guide is organized around the human anatomy with considerable attention devoted to proportion of the figure and how to portray bodies in motion and at rest. Bammes (The Artist&#39;s Guide to Human Anatomy) emphasizes the many drawings and illustrations of various styles packed tightly onto each page and allows them to do most of the explanatory work. Minimal text descriptions accompany the figure drawing examples, offering the reader necessary advice and highlighting technique. This guide will be most effective for serious intermediate and advanced artists who wish to improve their life drawing skills.-Library Journal USA</p><h2>Beach Bum Berry&#39;s Taboo Table</h2><p>THIS EDITION OF TABOO TABLE IS NOT SPIRAL BOUND.

Dino's wife, Viv, was out of town on business-she was an executive at the world's second-largest security company, Strategic Services, and had to travel a lot, so Stone and Dino were having, perhaps, their thousandth dinner together, just the two of them.<br> &nbsp;<br> The owner, Ken Aretzky, stopped by and bought them a drink, then continued on his rounds. They ordered the Caesar salad, a house specialty prepared at the table, and the chateaubri� and, medium rare, and Stone ordered a bottle of the Laughing Hare Cabernet.<br> &nbsp;<br> "Laughing Hare?" Dino asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> "A Cabernet you never heard of," Stone said. "Honest public servants can't afford it." Dino was New York City's commissioner of police, but the two men had been partners as homicide detec� tives many years before. "That's why I'm buying."<br> &nbsp;<br> The waiter brought the bottle and poured them a taste. Dino sampled it. "So I should consider this a bribe?"<br><br> "Let's call it a bribe in the bank, since there's nothing in par�&nbsp;ticular I want from you at the moment."<br> &nbsp;<br> "That makes a nice change," Dino said, and took a larger swig of the wine. "Not bad."<br><br> "You are given to understatement," Stone said. "Okay, it's pretty damn good."<br><br> Stone took a swig himself. "Better than that."<br> &nbsp;<br> "So how come you're alone tonight? Where's Pat Frank?" <br><br>"Who knows?" Stone said. "She has let it be known that she'd&nbsp;rather be alone than with me."<br> "What did you do?"<br><br> "It's what <i>you </i>did," Stone said. "You arrested her boyfriend on&nbsp;a double murder charge and her old friend as an accessory after the fact."<br><br> "And she blames you?"<br> &nbsp;<br> "I tried blaming you-it didn't work." "So she pulled the plug?"<br><br> "Not exactly, she just got really busy."<br> &nbsp;<br> "She just started a new business, maybe she is really just very busy."<br><br> "When I hear that excuse twice, I usually pull the plug myself. But the second time I was understanding, then I heard it a third time, and I got the message."<br><br> "I'm sure it's you, not her."<br> &nbsp;<br> "Isn't that line supposed to be the other way around?" "It's always you."<br><br> "What, am I too nice to them?"<br> &nbsp;<br> "Maybe. They don't always appreciate that the way you expect them to."<br><br> "You mean I should be less nice?"<br> &nbsp;<br> "Look at it this way," Dino said: "Her boyfriend had two arrests for domestic violence, both times against her, once with a gun, and still, she's upset that he's in jail. Does that make any sense?"<br><br> "None at all."<br> &nbsp;<br> "You've never been violent, have you? You take her out to good restaurants, you stay in good hotels, you have a jet airplane that you let her fly, because she can fly it better than you."<br><br> <i>"Had </i>a jet airplane," Stone pointed out. "Her boyfriend and her&nbsp;friend put a bomb in that airplane, which you detonated by pull�ing a string tied to the master switch."<br> &nbsp;<br> "Given the circumstances, I thought it was a better idea to pull the string than just sitting in the cockpit and flipping it to the on position, incinerating myself and, incidentally, you."<br><br> "I'll grant you that."<br> &nbsp;<br> "That's swell of you. When does the new airplane arrive?"<br> &nbsp;<br> "It's sitting in Wichita, ready to go, but the FAA hasn't certified it yet."<br><br> "Why not?"<br> &nbsp;<br> "Some sort of technicality, they tell me."<br> &nbsp;<br> They watched the maitre d' make their Caesar salad, then ate it and waited for their steak to arrive.<br><br> "Don't worry about Pat," Dino said. "As you always say,&nbsp;'Women are like cabs-there'll be another one along again in a minute."'<br><br> "I have never spoken those words in my life," Stone said, out�raged. "I have too much respect for women."<br> &nbsp;<br> "Well, maybe you didn't actually <i>say </i>that, I just read your mind."<br><br> "I've never thought it, either."<br> &nbsp;<br> "Now we're back to why they keep dumping you." <br><br>"Can you suggest a solution to that problem?" "Stop being so nice."<br><br> "I don't know how <i>not </i>to be nice. What should I do, beat them?" "Pat seemed to respond well to that."<br><br> "No she didn't, she took out a protection order against him." "She knew that wouldn't stop him, and it didn't."<br><br> Their chateaubriand arrived; the maitre d' presented it, sliced it, and served it.<br><br> They had just taken their first bite, when Dino's phone rang.<br> &nbsp;<br> "Uh-oh," he said, then put it to his ear. "What? Say again." He listened. "All right," he said wearily, "I'm on my way." He put the phone back in his pocket. "I gotta go."<br><br> "What is it?"<br> &nbsp;<br> "Does it matter? It's always something. We'll continue your education on the treatment of women at our next meeting."<br><br> "Oh, I'll really look forward to that."<br> &nbsp;<br> "And you'll have to eat my chateaubriand."<br> &nbsp;<br> "If I do that, I'll explode. I'll take it home and have it for lunch tomorrow."<br><br> "That makes me feel so much better," Dino said. He got to his&nbsp;feet, and a young woman appeared with his coat. "Talk to you tomorrow."<br><br> "What was it they used to say on <i>Hill Street Blues? </i>'Be careful out there."'<br><br> "Yeah, yeah," Dino said, then left.<br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Three-quarters of an hour later, Stone left the restaurant with a doggie bag and a recorked half-bottle of wine. He stepped onto the sidewalk and looked up the street to the other side, where Fred, his driver and factotum, sat in the Bentley. The head� lights came on, and the car started. It had just begun to pull away from the curb when another car roared past it, nearly hitting a&nbsp;fender, and screeched to a halt just past Stone.<br> &nbsp;<br> Two large men in suits spilled out of it and were all over a man who had just passed Stone on the sidewalk. They threw him against the wall and began searching him, while he protested.<br><br> "What is it?" he asked, and he had a slight accent of some sort. "What did I do?"<br><br> "Shut up," one of the men said, backhanding him.<br> &nbsp;<br> Stone saw the flash of a gold badge on his belt as he drew back to hit the man again. There was a blackjack in his hand.<br><br> "Hold it!" Stone shouted.<br> &nbsp;<br> The man froze for a moment, then turned toward Stone. "Did you say something to me?"<br> "I said hold it," Stone said more quietly.<br> &nbsp;<br> "Stay out of this, you dumb son of a bitch," the man said.<br><br>"That's an illegal weapon in your hand, Detective," Stone said.<br> &nbsp;<br> "If you hit him with it, I'll see that you spend the night in jail." Out of the corner of his eye Stone saw Fred get out of the car&nbsp;and unbutton his jacket. He raised a hand, motioning him to stop.<br><br> "Who the fuck do you think you are?" the cop said. "I'm a police officer, I can do whatever I want to this guy."<br><br> "Do you have a warrant?" Stone asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> "I don't need a warrant to use <i>this </i>on the guy"-he held up the blackjack-"and I'll use it on you, too, if you don't shut the fuck up and get out of my face."<br><br> "Take a look at this," Stone said, taking a gold badge from his pocket and holding it up. "Let me read it for you. It says, 'Detec� tive First Grade.' I'll bet yours says 'third grade.'"<br><br> The cop backed away a step. "You don't look like a cop to me," he said.<br><br> "You mean, because I'm not fat and ugly and wielding an illegal weapon?" Stone reached out and took the blackjack from him. <br><br>"Hey," the cop said.<br><br> "Ryan," his partner said, tugging at his sleeve, "back off."<br> &nbsp;<br> "What is this man charged with?" Stone asked. <br><br>"I haven't done anything!" the man said. "Come on, what has he done?"<br><br> "I haven't decided yet."<br> &nbsp;<br> Stone turned to the man. "Sir, I'm an attorney. Do you wish to have an attorney to represent you in this matter?'<br><br> "Yes, yes, I do."<br> &nbsp;<br> "Come on, Detective, what is my client charged with?" "You said you was a cop."<br> &nbsp;<br> "No, I just showed you my badge. I'm a retired cop." <br><br>"All right, give me my, ah, persuader, and we'll go." <br><br>"No," Stone said. "What precinct are you out of?" <br><br>"The Three-Five South."<br><br> "Let's see, your precinct commander is Captain O'Donnell, right? Why don't we get him out of bed and have a chat with him right now. Or, if you prefer, we can meet tomorrow morning in the commissioner's office and see what he has to say about this." He held up the blackjack.<br><br> "Look, mister, we don't want any trouble," the cop said. <br><br>"Then why are you still here?" Stone asked.<br><br> The two men got into their car and drove away. Stone turned to the man, who appeared to be in his sixties and Hispanic. "Are you all right?"<br><br> "Yes, I'm okay. Are the police always like this in New York?" <br><br>"Not usually, and I don't think you'll have any problem with&nbsp;him again tonight. Are you from out of town?"<br> &nbsp;<br> "From San Antonio, Texas. I'm in town on business." "Where are you staying?"<br><br> "At the Waldorf Towers."<br> &nbsp;<br> "Then let me give you a lift, it's not far."<br> &nbsp;<br> Fred opened a door for him, and they got in.<br> &nbsp;<br>"Fred, the Waldorf Towers." Stone turned to his guest. "My name is Stone Barrington." He offered his hand.<br><br> The man shook it. "I am Jose Perado," he said. "Please call me&nbsp;Pepe-everyone does."<br> &nbsp;<br> "What business are you in?"<br> &nbsp;<br> "I'm in the beer business. I'm a brewer. Perhaps you've heard of Cerveza Perado?"<br><br> "Yes, I have. I had it once in Texas. It's very good."<br> &nbsp;<br> "My grandfather started the business nearly a hundred years ago. I'm the third generation. Do you have a card, Mr. Barrington?"<br><br> "Of course." Stone handed him a card.<br> &nbsp;<br> "What kind of law do you practice?" Perado asked, looking at the card. "Oh, I've heard good things about Woodman &amp; Weld. I hope to visit them while I'm here."<br><br> "I practice mostly business law, and I'd be happy to introduce you to whoever you'd like to meet at Woodman &amp; Weld."<br><br> Fred drove the car to the Towers entrance at the Waldorf. "Here we are," Stone said.<br><br> "May I meet with you tomorrow, Mr. Barrington?" <br><br>"Yes, of course, and please call me Stone."<br><br> "Would ten tomorrow morning be all right?"<br> &nbsp;<br> "Of course. The address is on the card. My office is on the street level of my home. It's a short walk from the Waldorf."<br><br> "Until ten o'clock," Perado said. He shook Stone's hand, got out&nbsp;of the car, and went inside.<br> &nbsp;<br> Stone went home, resisted eating Dino's chateaubriand, and called his firm's managing partner, Bill Eggers.<br><br> "Hello?"<br> &nbsp;<br> "Good evening, Bill, it's Stone. I hoped you'd be awake."<br> &nbsp;<br> "I am now. This better be good news, I don't sleep well on bad news."<br><br> "Have you ever heard of a beer called Cerveza Perado?"<br> &nbsp;<br> "I have two six-packs of it in my bar downstairs. It's hard to come by outside of Texas-you have to know somebody."<br><br> "I chanced to meet Jose Perado, their third-generation CEO,&nbsp;this evening."<br><br> &nbsp;"And how did you manage that?"<br> &nbsp;<br> "I was coming out of Patroon as he was being 'set upon by footpads,' as Shakespeare once put it."<br>&nbsp;<br> "Right there in the street?"<br> &nbsp;<br> "Yep, and the footpads were cops. I took a blackjack away from one of them and threatened to call his captain, whereupon they dematerialized. I gave Pepe, as he likes to be called, a lift to the Waldorf Towers. He's in from San Antonio and looking for legal advice. I'm giving him some tomorrow morning. Would you like to join us?"<br>&nbsp;<br> "In my office?"<br> &nbsp;<br> "No, in mine, at home."<br> &nbsp;<br> "And that is supposed to impress him?"<br> &nbsp;<br> "No, you're supposed to do that. Ten o'clock?" <br><br>"See you then." Both men hung up.<br><br> Stone went to bed with dreams of beer bottles dancing in his head.<br><br><b>Chapter 2<br></b><br>Stone got to his desk by nine the following morning and called Dino.<br><br> &#x201c;Hey.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hey. After your departure last night I left Patroon and had a run-in with a couple of cops outside on the sidewalk.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What do you mean a &#x2018;run-in&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They screeched to a halt in front of the restaurant and attacked a passerby.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Passerby? You?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No, someone I&#x2019;d never seen before. They threw the guy against a wall and hit him, then one of them produced a black- jack and drew back on the guy.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Did they hit him with the blackjack?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No, I took it away from the cop and started asking questions.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> ''I'd have paid money to see that."<br> &nbsp;<br> "I'm giving you a firsthand account, free." <br>&nbsp;<br>"Goon."&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br> "I asked them what precinct they were in and they said the Three-Five South, and I cowed them by mentioning their captain's name."<br>&nbsp;<br> "O'Donnell?"<br> &nbsp;<br> "Right. They backed off, and I put the guy in my car and took him to his hotel, the Waldorf Towers."&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br> "Good for you. Get any names?"<br> &nbsp;<br> "One of the cops called the other 'Ryan.' That's all I got."<br> &nbsp;<br> "Ryan from the Three-Five South-that's a start. I'll get back to you."<br>&nbsp;<br> "Thanks."<br> &nbsp;<br>Stone returned phone calls, dictated letters, and filled out time sheets until Bob Eggers arrived, early.<br>&nbsp;<br> "So who's this guy we're meeting?"<br> &nbsp;<br> "I told you last night-just replay the conversation in your mind, then we'll start anew."<br>&nbsp;<br> "Okay, I've replayed it. What else can you tell me?"<br> &nbsp;<br> "That's it, that's all I know. The guy is, potentially, a produc�tive client."<br> &nbsp;<br> Joan came in with coffee and Eggers had some. Then Jose Per�ado arrived and introductions were made.<br> &nbsp;<br> Stone watched as Eggers went through his potential-client dance: he started with small talk, moved on to biography and&nbsp;business history and, obviously to Stone, found Perado accept�able as a client.<br> &nbsp;<br> "We'd be happy to represent you, Mr. Perado," <br><br>Eggers said. "Please call me Pepe, everybody everywhere does."<br>&nbsp;<br> "Pepe it is."<br> &nbsp;<br> "I'd like very much to be represented by Woodman &amp; Weld," Pepe said.<br>&nbsp;<br> "Then let me welcome you to our firm," Eggers said, standing up and shaking his hand.<br>&nbsp;<br> "Thank you, Bill."<br> &nbsp;<br> "Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm due for a meeting back at our real offices." He shot Stone a glance. "So, I'm going to leave you in the hands of our favorite partner, Stone, who will assess your immediate needs. I look forward to seeing you again soon." Eggers left.<br>&nbsp;<br> "That was easy," Pepe said.<br> &nbsp;<br> "Bill knows a good client when he sees one," Stone replied. "Now, let's talk about your immediate needs. What are they?"<br>&nbsp;<br> "Two, I think: a distributorship to buy, or alternately, a prop�erty where I can start one, and an ad agency."<br> &nbsp;<br> "Let's start with the ad agency," Stone said.

Pellicer selected some paintings, drawings, photographs, books and ceramics, maintaining the space just as Kahlo and Rivera had arranged it to live and work in. The rest of the objects, clothing, documents, drawings and letters, as well as over 6,000 photographs collected by Kahlo over the course of her life, were put away in bathrooms that had been converted into storerooms. This incredible trove remained hidden for more than half a century, until, just a few years ago, these storerooms and wardrobes were opened up. Kahlo's photograph collection was a major revelation among these finds, a testimony to the tastes and interests of the famous couple, not only through the images themselves but also through the telling annotations inscribed upon them. <i>Frida Kahlo: Her Photos</i> allows us to speculate about Kahlo's and Rivera's likes and dislikes, and to document their family origins; it supplies a thrilling and hugely significant addition to our knowledge of Kahlo's life and work.</p><p></p><h2>Mentor: The Kid &amp; The CEO</h2><p>Tony has no direction in life and no hope for his future ~ until he meets Malcolm, a businessman who has faced many of the same challenges.

A delicious lasagna can be ready in about an hour, or you could turn it into a project: try making and adding some homemade sausage. Explore the limits of from-scratch cooking: make your own pasta, grow your own tomatoes, and make your own homemade mozzarella and ricotta. Ruhlman tells you how.&nbsp;<br> There are easy and more complex versions for most dishes, vegetarian options, side dishes, sub-dishes, and strategies for leftovers.

The lessons are set up in such a way that you can decide exactly how deep a dive you want to take, though with a guide like&nbsp;Ruhlman&nbsp;at your side, that&#x2019;s most likely a mouth-first leap straight into the deep end.&#x201d; (J.

Call it an anti&#x2013;instruction manual if you will; his purpose is not to tell you how a certain dish must be created&#x2014;whether it&#x2019;s lasagna or bread pudding&#x2014;but rather to give you the tools and options to do it however you want.

As an Oklahoma City school teacher, Luper wrote a play for her pupils, who then toured cross-country with her and witnessed the contrast between the integrated Northern cities they visited and the still segregated Southern cities they performed in, and were subsequently motivated to affect positive change in their communities back home, including sit-ins. Rhuday-Perkovich's decision to include Luper's struggle between wanting to keep her students safe and wanting them to act humanizes this civil rights hero, and makes her choices more relatable and meaningful, as does the author's powerful word choice in describing the abusive drugstore customers not as anonymous bullies, but as spitting mothers and screaming fathers. This reminder that the struggle for equality is just as much mental as physical adds a welcome profundity. Johnson has illustrated the narrative in a tableau style, with a bold yellow- and blue-based color palette. The focal points are the expressive outsized faces of the cast of characters, who are all carefully posed. Unembellished backgrounds in muted tones make these characters (and several "whites only" signs) stand out all the more boldly. Back matter includes a brief biography of Luper and explains the four steps of nonviolent resistance depicted in the book. VERDICT Rhuday-Perkovich powerfully teaches young readers that standing up sometimes means standing out.

The murders in London between 1888-91 attributed to Jack the Ripper constitute one of the most mysterious unsolved criminal cases. This story is the result of many years meticulous research. The author reassesses all the evidence and challenges everything we thought we knew about the Victorian serial killer and the vanished East End he terrorized.</p><p>This exacting book adds a cogent historical investigation to the relatively few intelligent books about the father of all serial killers. Sensationalistic distortion and overimaginative theorizing have been part of this anonymous criminal's history since the first contemporaneous tabloid stories on the Whitechapel murders and continue in the inquiries of modern ``Ripperologists.'' For example, the letter signed ``Yours truly, Jack the Ripper'' that christened the legend was probably a journalist's headline-grabbing forgery, perpetuated in more hoax letters from the Ripper-crazed public. British historian Sugden corrects such myths and errors with donnish competitiveness, spending only a little time dispatching the more bizarre hypotheses (such as the recent Ripper diary hoax, the fanciful implication of the royal family in the murders, and the innumerable post-Victorian pseudo-suspects). Avoiding the penny-dreadful archives of Ripperology, he diligently approaches the voluminous police work and forensic evidence on the ``canonical'' four victims, all prostitutes, and an equal number of possible ones. Drawing on previous research and his own, he reexamines the eyewitnesses' testimony, inquest reports, newspaper accounts, and police leads (and red herrings). Although the material is still compelling and timely after a century, Sugden's sometimes sluggish prose and narrative do not bring to life the panicked atmosphere of the East End or the tensions within the police department. In the end, though many inconsistencies are swept away and many ambiguities left warily intact, Sugden produces an approximate modus operandi around which a convincing psychological profile can be constructed. His examination of suspects exonerates previous favorites, such as Michael Ostrog, whom Assistant Chief Constable Melville Macnaghten called a ``mad Russian doctor''; but with even his preferred suspect, a Polish con man and poisoner, he reaches the verdict ``not proven.'' Sugden's factual treatment of the murders provides a meticulous and reasoned profile for readers and future detectives. (Photos and maps, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>The series of murders in London in 1888 attributed to someone called Jack the Ripper constitute one of the most famous and mysterious unsolved criminal cases. Time has not diminished the gruesomeness of the killings: all the victims' throats were cut (some were almost beheaded), some victims were disemboweled, and from a few the killer took organs. When fear of the Ripper peaked, the killings stopped, and a century of speculation ensued. Sugden does not resist adding to the inquiry a chapter on his theory of Jack's identity, yet his book isn't intended to solve the puzzle. Rather, he painstakingly sifts through press clippings and police records to dispel misinformation, much of it stemming from police refusal to release information to the newspapers, as a result of which the press published rumors as facts, which were subsequently used by researchers as the basis of their books. Sugden is exhaustive, and his book is for the serious student, not light reading. Future writers on Jack the Ripper will use this text as the basis of their research. <i>Jon Kartman</i></p><h2>Can You Find Jesus?

When missionary Dr. Marcus Whitman and his wife agree to let Grace and her sisters stay at their mission for the winter, Grace is grateful.

The briefest, clearest, and most refined account of his influential approach to the subject, the book will be invaluable to all students of philosophy and physics.</p><p>Quantum mechanics holds a unique place in the history of physics. It has produced the most accurate predictions of any scientific theory, but, more astonishing, there has never been any agreement about what the theory implies about physical reality. Maudlin argues that the very term &#x201c;quantum theory&#x201d; is a misnomer. A proper physical theory should clearly describe what is there and what it does&#x2015;yet standard textbooks present quantum mechanics as a predictive recipe in search of a physical theory.</p><p>In contrast, Maudlin explores three proper theories that recover the quantum predictions: the indeterministic wavefunction collapse theory of Ghirardi, Rimini, and Weber; the deterministic particle theory of deBroglie and Bohm; and the conceptually challenging Many Worlds theory of Everett. Each offers a radically different proposal for the nature of physical reality, but Maudlin shows that none of them are what they are generally taken to be.</p></p><p><b>Tim Maudlin</b> is professor of philosophy at New York University. He is the author of <i>Philosophy of Physics: Space and Time </i>(Princeton), <i>Quantum Non-Locality and Relativity: Metaphysical Intimations of Modern Physics</i>, <i>The Metaphysics within Physics</i>, and <i>Truth and Paradox</i>."Maudlin's book . . . should have been subtitled &#x2018;Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Quantum Theory (But Were Afraid to Ask)&#x2019; . . . its plain presentation style makes it a good introductory book for students and non-specialists. In short, it is highly recommended for anybody interested in quantum theory."

But as a little boy, raised in violence and excluded from the family home, she just wanted to belong. Now she believes her clients deserve no less. A woman who sleeps among rubbish she has not put out for forty years. A man who bled quietly to death in his loungeroom. A woman who lives with rats, random debris and terrified delusion. The still life of a home vacated by accidental overdose. Sarah Krasnostein has watched the extraordinary Sandra Pankhurst bring order and care to these, the living and the dead - and the book she has written is equally extraordinary. Not just the compelling story of a fascinating life among lives of desperation, but an affirmation that, as isolated as we may feel, we are all in this together.</p><p></p><h2>Praying Through the Names of Jesus (The Names of God Series)</h2><p><p><b>Are You Making the Most of Praying Jesus&#x2019; Names?</b><br><br> In the Bible, names are significant&#x2014;an important window into who someone is.

In <i>Dataclysm</i>, Christian Rudder uses it to show us who we truly are. <br> &nbsp;<br> For centuries, we&#x2019;ve relied on polling or small-scale lab experiments to study human behavior. Today, a new approach is possible. As we live more of our lives online, researchers can finally observe us directly, in vast numbers, and without filters. Data scientists have become the new demographers.<br> &nbsp;<br> In this daring and original book, Rudder explains how Facebook "likes" can predict, with surprising accuracy, a person&#x2019;s sexual orientation and even intelligence; how attractive women receive exponentially more interview requests; and why you must have haters to be hot. He charts the rise and fall of America&#x2019;s most reviled word through Google Search and examines the new dynamics of collaborative rage on Twitter. He shows how people express themselves, both privately and publicly. What is the least Asian thing you can say? Do people bathe more in Vermont or New Jersey? What do black women think about Simon &amp; Garfunkel? (Hint: they don&#x2019;t think about Simon &amp; Garfunkel.) Rudder also traces human migration over time, showing how groups of people move from certain small towns to the same big cities across the globe. And he grapples with the challenge of maintaining privacy in a world where these explorations are possible.<br> &nbsp;<br> Visually arresting and full of wit and insight, <i>Dataclysm</i> is a new way of seeing ourselves&#x2014;a brilliant alchemy, in which math is made human and numbers become the narrative of our time.</p><p><p><b>Q&amp;A with Christian Rudder, cofounder of OkCupid and author of <i>Dataclysm</i></b></p> <p><b>As more of our social interaction happens on social media, how much can researchers learn about us from our online interactions? </b> </p> <p>Well, they can only learn what we tell them, but in the age of Facebook and Google, that&#x2019;s become pretty much everything. To the extent that friendship, anger, sex, love, and whatever else happen online, we can investigate them. </p> <p> Your search history tells us what kind of jokes you like. Your Facebook network reveals not just your friendships, but in some cases the state of your marriage. Your preferences on OkCupid tell us what you find sexy, and your reaction to the strangers the site offers up tells us how you judge people. The articles you &#x201c;like&#x201d; tell us not just about your politics, but even predict your intelligence. </p> <p>You fold in data points like these for millions and millions of people, and you start to get a whole new picture of humankind. </p> <p><b>In Dataclysm you&#x2019;re taking this flood of information and putting it to an entirely new use: understanding human nature. So what have you found?</b> </p> <p>I tried really hard to avoid the numerical dog and pony show. There are of course lots of interesting one-off factoids, but I mostly found what I (and probably you) have always known: that people are gentle, mean, stupid, lusty, lonely, kind, foolish, shrewd, shallow, and endlessly complex. <i>Dataclysm&#x2019;s</i> central idea isn&#x2019;t necessarily what we can see using big data; it&#x2019;s the fact of the vision itself. That we can get real data on even the most private moments in people&#x2019;s lives is an astounding thing. It&#x2019;s like the second advent of reality television, but this time without the television part. Just the reality. </p> <p><b>Are you worried about any of this? </b></p> <p>I have mixed feelings about the implications. I myself almost never tweet, post, or share anything about my personal life. At the same time, I&#x2019;ve just spent three years writing about how interesting all this data is, and I cofounded OkCupid. My hope is that this ambivalence makes me a trustworthy guide through the thicket of technology and data. I admire the knowledge that social data can bring us; I also fear the consequences. </p> <p><b>You have a lot to say about race in the book, and you use data to shed light on the many ways it affects the way we interact with one another. What surprised you about your research in this area? Did you find anything unsurprising? </b> </p> <p>The data on race was surprising only in its stubborn predictability&#x2014;for all the glitzy technology, the results could&#x2019;ve been from the 1950s. I grew up in Little Rock and graduated from Central High, the first school in the South to be integrated: Eisenhower, the National Guard, mobs of white people screaming at nine black children, that&#x2019;s Central. The school embraces its history and is now over half black. I&#x2019;m no brave crusader, but race (and racism) were part of my education. So when, in researching the book, I unpacked three separate databases and found that in every one white people gave black people short-shrift, I wasn&#x2019;t shocked, you know? Asians and Latinos apply the same penalty to African Americans that white folks do, which says something about how even (relatively) recent additions to the &#x201c;American experience&#x201d; have acquired its biases. </p> <p><b>What makes this moment in time&#x2014;and this set of data&#x2014;different from the massive data surveys of the past, such as Pew, Gallup, or the Kinsey Institute? </b></p> <p>The data in my book is almost all passively observed&#x2014;there&#x2019;s no questionnaire, no contrived experiment to simulate &#x201c;real life.&#x201d; This data is real life. Online you have friends, lovers, enemies, and intense moments of truth without a thought for who&#x2019;s watching, because ostensibly no one is&#x2014;except of course the computers recording it all. This is how digital data circumvents that old research obstacle: people&#x2019;s inability to be honest when the truth makes them look bad. Digital data&#x2019;s ability to get at the private mind like this is unprecedented and very powerful. </p><b>Christian Rudder</b> is a co-founder and former president of the dating site OkCupid, where he authored the popular OkTrends blog.

We have put into practice the truths shared in this book. For well over a half-century in more than eighty nations, we have communicated the good news publicly, out where the poeple are, addressing audiences of 20,000 to 300,000 people. <p>Discover the secret, the pleasure, the exhiliration of sharing God's love in a hurting world. Experience new self-esteem. Winning others, you truly win Christ. Enriching people, your own life is enriched. -T.L. Osborn </p><p>I am convinced this is the finest book that my father has yet authored. As a world evangelist, a teacher, a pastor, and a bishop, I know of no other literary work that brings such biblical focus to pastors and leaders, and such practical insight and uplifting self-esteem to Christian believers. </p><p>This book has changed the world, lifting the laity from the gallery of spectators to the arena of action, revealing dignity and purpose for liviing. No wonder ministers call it A Classic on Biblical Christianity. -LaDonna Osborn</p></p><p>The ministries of T. L. and Daisy Osborn have made an unprecedented impact on the world in our time. They are valued among the great soulwinners of this century. <p>Married at ages 17 and 18, the Osborns were missionaries in India at 20 and 21. In 1949 they instituted the OSFO International Gospel Center-a world evangelism and missionary church organization. Their life commitment: To express and to propagate the gospel of Jesus Christ to people throughout the world. </p><p>Their guiding principle: the top priority of the church is the evangelization of the world. The Osborns have conducted mass crusades in over 70 nations, preaching to audiences ranging from 20,000 to 250,000 nightly and more. They have sponsored over 25,000 national preachers as full-time missionaries, reaching their own unreached tribes and villages. They have published gospel literature in 132 languages and dialects. They have produced documentary films and crusade tapes for public evangelism in nearly 80 major languages. They have provided airlifts and huge shipments of soulwinning tools for gospel missions and workers worldwide. They have furnished vehicles with films, projectors, screens, generators, P.A. systems, audio cassettes and cassette players, and great quantities of literature for evangelism abroad. </p><p>They are energetic and prolific writers. T.L. Osborn's living classic, Healing The Sick-now in its 62nd printing-has been a faith-building best-seller since 1951. Their big 512 page Classic Documentary--The Gospel According to T.L. &amp; Daisy, is unmatched among Christian Publications. </p><p>The Osborns have probably reached and led more unreached souls to Jesus Christ in non-Christian lands, and may have witnessed more great healing miracles, than any other couple who has ever yet lived. Their team efforts in world evangelism are truly pace-setting as they proclaim the good news to the world: that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, and today, and forever.

Then along came an even BIGGER monster who changed their minds. And all it took was two little words.<br>In this playful tale from bestselling picture book author Patrick McDonnell, a very BIG monster shows three very BAD little monsters the power of boundless gratitude.</p><p>Patrick McDonnell is the creator of <i>Thank You and Good Night</i>, <i>A Perfectly Messed-Up Story</i>, <i>The Monsters' Monster</i>, and <i>Me...Jane</i>, a Caldecott Honor Book. He is also the creator of the internationally syndicated comic strip <i>Mutts, </i>which inspired his picture books <i>The Gift of Nothing</i>, <i>Hug Time</i>, and others. He lives in New Jersey.PreS-1-Three little monsters love to CRASH!, BASH!, and SMASH! Every day they argue over who is the best monster, until they join forces to "make a MONSTER monster. The biggest, baddest monster EVER!" At first, their efforts look successful, but to their horror, the creature's first words after tearing off his bandages are "Dank you." The enormous Frankenstein look-alike contents himself with breathing fresh air and gently greeting the spiders, bats, and rats in the castle. But just as the little monsters begin to despair, Monster lets out a ROAR and smashes through the dungeon wall, heading toward the "monster-fearing village" below. Is he finally off to make mayhem? Or will his exploits end in a lesson for the little monsters about gratitude and sharing? McDonnell's monsters are comic and endearing, and the book's colors gently shift from dark and gloomy to warm as the story progresses. The message is well executed, and the little beasts' exuberance at their badness keeps the tale from devolving into platitudes.

When she was married at sixteen to a German count far below her rank, it was with the understanding that her father would help her husband achieve the kingship of Bohemia. The terrible betrayal of this commitment would ruin "the Winter Queen," as Elizabeth would forever be known, imperil the lives of those she loved, and launch a war that would last for thirty years. <br>Forced into exile, the Winter Queen and her family found refuge in Holland, where the glorious art and culture of the Dutch Golden Age indelibly shaped her daughters' lives. Her eldest, Princess Elizabeth, became a scholar who earned the respect and friendship of the philosopher Ren� Descartes. Louisa was a gifted painter whose engaging manner and appealing looks provoked heartache and scandal. Beautiful Henrietta Maria would be the only sister to marry into royalty, although at great cost. But it was the youngest, Sophia, a heroine in the tradition of a Jane Austen novel, whose ready wit and good-natured common sense masked immense strength of character, who fulfilled the promise of her great-grandmother Mary and reshaped the British monarchy, a legacy that endures to this day.<br>Brilliantly researched and captivatingly written, filled with danger, treachery, and adventure but also love, courage, and humor, <i>Daughters of the Winter Queen </i>follows the lives of five remarkable women who, by refusing to surrender to adversity, changed the course of history.</p><p><b>Nancy Goldstone</b> is the author of five previous books including <em>The Rival Queens: Catherine de' Medici, Her Daughter Marguerite de Valois, and the Betrayal that Ignited a Kingdom; The Maid and the Queen: The Secret History of Joan of Arc; Four Queens: The Proven�al Sisters Who Ruled Europe</em>;<em> </em>and <em>The Lady Queen: The Notorious Reign of Joanna I, Queen of Naples, Jerusalem, and Sicily</em>. She has also coauthored six books with her husband, Lawrence Goldstone. She lives in Sagaponack, New York."Goldstone's forthright and often witty asides keep this complicated story bowling along at a terrific pace...Lively and well-researched, <i>Daughters of the Winter Queen</i> offers a timely introduction to a turbulent period in Britain's past relations with Europe."&#x2015;<b>Miranda Seymour</b>, <b><i><i>New York Times Book Review</i></i></b><br><br>"Goldstone is a master juggler.

In the process, extraordinary women are given the attention they deserve."&#x2015;<b>Gerard DeGroot</b>, <b><i><i>The Times of London</i></i></b><br><br>"Goldstone is a thrilling narrator of this complicated history. Yet the achievement of a work like this is not merely its command of a vast and dense web of the past, but also its incredible literary merit. <i>Daughters of the Winter Queen </i>is nothing short of page-turning, an exceptional work of scholarship that reads like a favorite novel filled with political intrigue, romantic scandal, and more than one dark-of-night escape."&#x2015;<b><i><i>East Hampton Star</i></i></b><br><br>"A fascinating feminist story."&#x2015;<b><i><i>The Coil</i></i></b><br><br>"This rich and complex story of a seventeenth century queen who lost her throne, and her four defiant daughters, is compulsively readable.

Goldstone writes with knowledge, humor, and ease--a masterly storyteller who steers clear of overly academic language. Ideal for amateur Tudor historians who wish to be introduced to a lesser-known yet equally fascinating royal family."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Library Journal </i>(starred review)</i></b><br><br>"Goldstone relates the eminently readable tale of Elizabeth Stuart, dubbed the Winter Queen, and her four lovely, talented daughters...The story of these five women, each remarkable for individual reasons and in her own right, both illuminates and is offset by Goldstone's vividly rendered European backdrop."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Booklist</i></i></b><br><br>"Though the narrative could have devolved into a complicated mass of intertwined royal families, Goldstone, a seasoned historian, effectively keeps the lines clear as she relates Elizabeth's repeated, frustrated attempts to secure strong marriages for her children under trying circumstances. Her children's stories are fascinating, as well...A great book for history fans seeking illumination on the connections of European royalty."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Kirkus</i></i></b><br><br>"A lively, well-researched group biography...Goldstone presents a captivating story with empathy and humor in a relaxed, entertaining, modern voice."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Publishers Weekly</i></i></b></p><h2>Night Night, Farm</h2><p><p>Moo moo, cows!</p><p>Baa baa, sheep!</p><p>When the sun sinks low down on the farm, the animals are all tuckered out from the day&#x2019;s adventures.

He works from the&nbsp;premise that we can't truly appreciate the New Testament unless we understand the Old Testament.&nbsp;<br><br>By uncovering the teaching of the first and second century rabbis and Christian theologians, and highlighting little-known Jewish idioms and traditions, Gallaty takes Christians on a biblical journey to rediscover a forgotten Jesus from a biblical perspective, deepening your relationship with God.</p><p><p>Robby Gallaty (PhD, New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary) is the Senior Pastor of Long Hollow Baptist Church in Hendersonville, TN. He was radically saved out of a life of drug addiction on November 12, 2002. In 2008, he founded Replicate Ministries to educate, equip, and empower believers to make disciples who make disciples (replicate.org). He is the author of <em>Rediscovering Discipleship, Growing Up,</em> <em>Firmly</em> <em>Planted</em>, and <em>Bearing Fruit</em>. Robby and his wife Kandi are the proud parents of two sons, Rig and Ryder.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>Here's what others are saying:&nbsp;<br><br>"Throughout this book, Robby shows how the New Testament comes alive with a robust understanding of the Old. However, as with Jewish rabbis of old, he isn't satisfied to stop with correct thinking--he pushes us onward to correct living."<br><b>J.D. Greear,</b>&nbsp;pastor, The Summit Church<br><br>"The message of Jesus may be timeless. But his life, teachings, death, and resurrection were all time-stamped. They took place in the real word at a specific time and place. In The Forgotten Jesus, Robby Gallaty helps us better understand the long-forgotten culture and context of Jesus's life and ministry so that we may better grasp the timeless beauty and power of his gospel."<br><b>Larry Osborne</b>, Pastor and Author, North Coast Church<br><br>"For many years, First Fruits of Zion has aimed to help Christians to know Jesus better by seeing Him in His Jewish context. Pastor Robby Gallaty is a pastor and Bible teacher who shares that vision. &nbsp;His new book "The Forgotten Jesus" will help Christians to remember the Jewish Jesus that has largely been forgotten. &nbsp;Read this book if you want to know and follow our Master better!"<br><b>Boaz Michael</b>&nbsp;- Founder and Director of First Fruits of Zion - Jerusalem, Israel<br><br>"Looking for something new? Look to something old!

Don't miss this treasure that God has revealed through Robby Gallaty."<br><b>Bryant Wright</b>, Senior pastor of Johnson Ferry Baptist Church, Marietta, GA&nbsp;<br><br>"Robby's passion for Jesus ignites and unites the way he thinks, speaks, and acts. His design in this book is to help you do the same. To my mind, he achieves that goal. Do you crave to love God as Father, the way Jesus did? Read on! And may the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob grant you the desire of your heart."<br><b>James Whitman</b>, Director, Center for Judaic-Christian Studies<br><br>"I'm delighted to see Robby Gallaty's The Forgotten Jesus and know it will be of great benefit for anyone wanting to understand Jesus' Jewish context.

But Christians aim to be ethical in all the areas of daily life and work&#x2015;not just when the spotlight is on them. For those facing the many questions and quandaries of doing business with ethical integrity, Alec Hill offers a place to begin. In this third edition of a popular textbook on business ethics, Hill carefully explores the foundational Christian concepts of holiness, justice, and love. These keys to God's character, he argues, are also the keys to Christian business ethics. Hill then shows how some common responses to business ethics fall short of a fully Christian mindset. Using penetrating case studies on such pressing topics as employer-employee relations, discrimination and affirmative action, and environmental damage, he clothes principles in concrete business situations. Updated throughout, and with a new chapter on international business, this new edition of <em>Just Business</em> is an excellent introduction to business ethics for students, and a timely refresher for men and women already in the marketplace.</p><p>"Alec Hill is a keen thinker, a terrific leader, and a cherished friend. It's hard to think of a better guide through the challenges and complexities of business ethics. His words will help you to not just make wiser choices, but to become a better person." (John Ortberg, senior pastor, Menlo Church, author of All the Places to Go)<br><br>"In this updated third edition, Alec Hill offers the probing reader a deeply rooted, integrated perspective, one that wrestles with questions, provokes with examples, and, in a new chapter, grapples with the ambiguities and complexities of global business." (Robert W. Lane, retired chairman and CEO, John Deere)Alec Hill is president emeritus of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA.

It is the region's leading voice for the protection and restoration of dwindling ancient forests in the Pacific Northwest region, of Oregon&#x2019;s fragile population of gray wolves, and of the wetlands of the Klamath Basin. Protecting ancient forests is a key part of Oregon Wild's history and future.

Since then it has advanced protection for millions of acres of old-growth habitat through wilderness legislation, the Northwest Forest Plan, and the "eastside screens." And it has supported campaigns to secure permanent protection of mature and old-growth forests in the Northwest through federal legislation. Oregon Wild continues to devote significant resources to advocate for the protection and restoration of Oregon&#x2019;s last remaining old-growth forests.A worthy fit on any bookshelf.

Barbara Coloroso shows these principles in action through dozens of examples -- from sibling rivalry to teenage rebellion; from common misbehaviors to substance abuse and antisocial behavior. She also explains how to parent strong-willed children, effective alternatives to time-outs, bribes, and threats, and how to help kids resolve disputes and serious injustices such as bullying. </p><p>Filled with practical suggestions for handling the ordinary and extraordinary tribulations of growing up, <em>kids are worth it!</em> helps you help your children grow into responsible, resilient, resourceful adults -- not because you tell them to, but because they want to.</p></p><p><p>Barbara Coloroso is the author of the international bestseller <em>Kids Are Worth It!</em> and <em>Parenting Through Crisis</em> and is an acclaimed speaker on parenting, teaching, conflict, resolution, and grieving.

Throughout the six tapes, Coloroso tackles some of the most difficult topics, from how to teach a toddler the meaning of &#34;no,&#34; to handling a troublesome teen. Coloroso&#39;s voice and presentation are comforting and easy to listen to.

It sets forth biblical proof and irrefutable evidence that will cause the scales to fall from your eyes and reveal that the world you thought existed is a myth. The most universally accepted scientific belief today is that the earth is a globe, spinning on its axis at a speed of approximately 1,000 miles per hour at the equator, while at the same time it is orbiting the sun at approximately 66,600 miles per hour. All of this is happening as the sun, in turn, is supposed to be hurtling through the Milky Way galaxy at approximately 500,000 miles per hour. The Milky Way galaxy, itself, is alleged to be racing through space at a speed ranging from 300,000 to 1,340,000 miles per hour. What most people are not told is that the purported spinning, orbiting, and speeding through space has never been proven. In fact, every scientific experiment that has ever been performed to determine the motion of the earth has proven that the earth is stationary. Yet, textbooks ignore the scientific proof that contradicts the myth of a spinning and orbiting globe. Christian schools have been hoodwinked into teaching heliocentrism, despite the clear teaching in the bible that the earth is not a sphere and does not move. This book reveals the evil forces behind the heliocentric deception, and why scientists and the Christian churches have gone along with it.</p></p><p><p>Unsolicited Reviews Posted on Amazon of the Previous Edition of The Greatest Lie on Earth:</p><p>"One of the top 3 absolute best books I've ever read!

Hendrie goes through great details in this book, from the moon landing to CGI and composite photos of the earth to numerous scientific experiments showing that the earth is stationary. I'm very very glad that I bought this book. I also tried to fact check some things mentioned in this book and everything was there after a quick Google search." Derek Fernandez</p><p>"This is the second most important book I have read after the Holy Bible. First of all this book conclusively proves the earth is flat with endless irrefutable examples. Second, the author exposes who is behind this tremendous deception and why. This book is loaded with information on every page and is extremely easy to read." Russell Buecher</p><p>"Well written, well-researched book. I found this book fascinating, and also very disturbing. Fascinating since it's hard for me to imagine that I don't live in a heliocentric type of universe, disturbing in the depth, power, and evil nature of the forces that created this deception. I would love to dismiss the conspiracy aspect of this book, but, it's very well referenced and is not truly conspiratorial due to its sourcing. It's more of an account of events with sources given that we just haven't heard about before since it wasn't well reported on. Hendrie does a great job tying all the strings together, this really is a stand-alone book which could include many other books on different topics yet it is briefly all covered here in sufficient detail to give a good overall picture."

The rise of the Internet and the wide availability of inexpensive computers have made it possible to gather and analyze network data on an unprecedented scale, and the development of new theoretical tools has allowed us to extract knowledge from networks of many different kinds. The study of networks is broadly interdisciplinary and central developments have occurred in many fields, including mathematics, physics, computer and information sciences, biology, and the social sciences. This book brings together the most important breakthroughs in each of these fields and presents them in a coherent fashion, highlighting the strong interconnections between work in different areas.<br><br>Topics covered include the measurement of networks; methods for analyzing network data, including methods developed in physics, statistics, and sociology; fundamentals of graph theory; computer algorithms; mathematical models of networks, including random graph models and generative models; and theories of dynamical processes taking place on networks.<br></p><p><br>Mark Newman, <em>Anatol Rapoport Distinguished University Professor of Physics, University of Michigan, USA</em><br><br>Mark Newman received a D.Phil. in physics from the University of Oxford in 1991 and conducted postdoctoral research at Cornell University before joining the staff of the Santa Fe Institute, a think-tank in New Mexico devoted to the study of complex systems.

I want you to remember what I&#x2019;m going to tell you. You have to stay alive. You have to! Get someone to teach you how to act like a Christian, how to cross yourself and pray. . . . The most important thing, Srulik,' he said, talking fast, 'is to forget your name. Wipe it from your memory. . . . But even if you forget everything&#x2014;even if you forget me and Mama&#x2014;never forget that you&#x2019;re a Jew.'"<br><br>And so, at only eight years old, Srulik Frydman says goodbye to his father for the last time and becomes Jurek Staniak, an orphan on the run in the Polish countryside at the height of the Holocaust. With the danger of capture by German soldiers ever-present, Jurek must fight against starvation, the punishing Polish winters, and widespread anti-Semitism as he desperately searches for refuge. Told with the unflinching honesty and unique perspective of such a young child, Run, Boy, Run is the extraordinary account of one boy&#x2019;s struggle to stay alive in the face of almost insurmountable odds&#x2014;a story all the more incredible because it is true.</p><p>Uri Orlev was born in Warsaw in 1931. In 1996, Uri Orlev received the the highest international recognition given to an author of children&#x2019;s books. He now lives in Jerusalem.*Starred Review* Reviewed with Jerry Spinelli's <i>Milkweed</i>.Holocaust survivor stories for teens run the risk of being either too brutal or too sentimental. These two novels avoid sensationalizing the violence because, in each case, the protagonist is a child too young to understand what's going on, which distances the horror. In both books the child is saved, but there's no radiant uplift about rescuers. Yes, some heroes do hide the children and help them, but as John Auerbach shows in his adult autobiographical story collection, <i>The Owl and Other Stories</i> [BKL S 15 03], which centers on escaping the Warsaw ghetto, luck and wild coincidence were a large part of what enabled a few to live. <p>Part survival adventure, part Holocaust history, these novels tell their story through the eyes of a Polish orphan on the run from the Nazis. Orlev is a Holocaust survivor, and his award-winning novels about being a child in the Warsaw ghetto, including <i>The Man from the Other Side</i> (1991), are widely read. This new story is not based on his own experience, but it does come from real life--the experience of an illiterate ghetto survivor who escaped into the Polish countryside, stealing, foraging, begging, working. The boy is nurtured by some and hated by many. He hides his circumcision and invents a Catholic identity; he forgets his real name, his family, and the street where he lived. In one unforgettable incident, he loses his right arm because a Polish doctor refuses to operate on a Jew. He survives, immigrating to Israel, where Orlev hears him tell his story. The narrative is simple and spare, factual about everything from hunting with a slingshot to making a fire with a piece of glass, and it's always true to the viewpoint of a boy who thinks he is "about nine."</p><p>In contrast, Spinelli's narrative is manic, fast, and scattered, authentically capturing the perspective of a young child who doesn't know if he's a Jew or a Gypsy; he has never known family or community. He lives by stealing; his name may be Stopthief. Unlike Orlev's protagonist, this boy lives in the ghetto, where the daily atrocities he witnesses-- hanging bodies, massacres, shootings, roundups, transports--are the only reality he knows. His matter-of-fact account distances the brutality without sensationalizing or lessening the truth. He first finds shelter with a gang of street kids, where one fierce older boy protects him, invents an identity for him, and teaches him survival skills. Later he lives with a Jewish family. The history is true, so although Spinelli's narrator is young, the brutal realism in the story makes this a book for older children. Both novels end with what seems to be a contrived escape, though in Orlev's story, the ending is true. Add these stirring titles to the Holocaust curriculum; the youth of the protagonists allows them to ask questions and get answers that will help readers learn the history. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

All of this is tragically wrong.<br><br>Renowned educator and author E. D. Hirsch, Jr., argues that, by disdaining content-based curricula while favoring abstract--and discredited--theories of how a child learns, the ideas uniformly taught by our schools have done terrible harm to America's students. Instead of preparing our children for the highly competitive, information-based economy in which we now live, our schools' practices have severely curtailed their ability, and desire, to learn.<br><br>With an introduction that surveys developments in education since the hardcover edition was published, <b>The Schools We Need</b> is a passionate and thoughtful book that will appeal to the millions of people who can't understand why America's schools aren't educating our children.</p><p>Everyone wonders why American schools have gone bad. E.D. Hirsch, author of Cultural Literacy, offers a compelling explanation. Schools do a lousy job of transmitting &#34;core knowledge&#34; to their students, he says. To improve, they must abandon all of their feel-good theories about &#34;critical thinking&#34; and work harder to endow kids with intellectual capital at an early age. It may sound like common sense, but this important book shows why so many educators appear to have lost theirs.The author of <i>Cultural Literacy</i> offers a powerful, compelling, and unassailable argument for reforming America's schooling methods and ideas.<p></p><p>From kindergarten through high school, the American education is the worst in the developed world, and the causes of its failure and any possible solutions to it are hotly disputed. For over fifty years, American schools have operated on the assumption that challenging children is bad for them, teachers do not need to know the subjects they teach, that the learning "process" should be emphasised over the facts taught within it. Yet, as renowned educator and author E. D. Hirsch shows in <i>The Schools We Need</i>, this establishment ideology is a tragedy of good intentions gone awry. Hirsch argues that in eschewing content-based curricula for abstract--and disproved--theories of congnitive development, the educational establishment has done irreparable harm to America's students, and instead of preparing them for the country's highly competitive, information-based economy, the process-oriented curricula the establishment practices has severely curtailed their ability, and desire, to learn.</p><p></p><p>Suggesting a curriculum based on hard work, knowledge aquisition, and rigorous testing that has been proven successful time after time, <i>The Schools We Need</i> offers a proficient and workable solution. By providing evidence of numerous studies proving that fact-based education works, and a glossary of brief, authoritative explanations of educational phrases often used to dazzle teachers and the general public, Hirsch proves that if children are taught substantial knowledge and skills, and learn to work hard to acquire them, their test scores will rise, their love of learning will grow, and they will become enthusiastic participants in the information-age civilization.</p><p></p><p><i>The Schools We Need</i> is a passionate and thoughtful book that will appeal to the millions of people who can't understand why American schools just don't work.</p></p><h2>Volume 1: Arabic-English Dictionary: The Hans Wehr Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic.

While fueling extraordinary advances in all fields of human endeavor, this vision perpetuated a hidden yet persistent agenda: the delusion that human nature and society could be fitted into precise and manageable rational categories. Stephen Toulmin confronts that agenda&#x2014;its illusions and its consequences for our present and future world.<br><br>"By showing how different the last three centuries would have been if Montaigne, rather than Descartes, had been taken as a starting point, Toulmin helps destroy the illusion that the Cartesian quest for certainty is intrinsic to the nature of science or philosophy."&#x2014;Richard M.

In 1996 he earned a bachelor&#39;s degree in Vocational Education with an emphasis on massage therapy from the University of Idaho. A skiing accident in 1990 resulted in a C-6 spinal cord injury that landed Mark in a wheelchair with quadriplegia. That ended his active practice as a massage therapist but did not quell his dedication to the profession or his desire to provide the best possible information to thousands of students entering the profession by continually updating and refining The Theory and Practice of Therapeutic Massage. Mark continued to be an advocate for excellence in massage education and accessibility for the disabled until he sadly passed away in November 2016."The Beck textbook is filled with an incredible amount of knowledge for the up and coming massage therapist. The real-life photos in the text help to reinforce the lessons in each chapter."<br><br>"I was extremely impressed by the quality of this new text and how it encompassed every aspect of massage therapy all 'under one roof'.

Old hierarchical models of collection and analysis must give way to horizontal, networked solutions. In <em>Intelligence Analysis</em>, Robert M. Clark explains that a collaborative, target-centric approach allows for more effective analysis, while better meeting customer needs. </p><p>The new third edition has been comprehensively revised to reflect changes in the constantly shifting landscape of intelligence. With new examples throughout, <em>Intelligence Analysis</em> now includes discussions of framing effects, human terrain models, cyber collection, computer network exploitation, and more. Further, a new section on the "defense analysis challenge" clarifies the relationship between the analyst and the customer. Once again, Clark has updated the practical information and day-to-day details as only an experienced hand could, bringing essential clarity and insight to this "must-have" resource.</p></p><p><p><b>Robert M.

Challenging and displacing decades of received wisdom, T. H. Breen's strikingly original book explains how ordinary Americans&#x2015;most of them members of farm families living in small communities&#x2015;were drawn into a successful insurgency against imperial authority. </p><p>A few celebrated figures in the Continental Congress do not make for a revolution. It requires tens of thousands of ordinary men and women willing to sacrifice, kill, and be killed. Breen not only gives the history of these ordinary Americans but, drawing upon a wealth of rarely seen documents, restores their primacy to American independence. Mobilizing two years before the Declaration of Independence, American insurgents in all thirteen colonies concluded that resistance to British oppression required organized violence against the state. They channeled popular rage through elected committees of safety and observation, which before 1776 were the heart of American resistance. <i>American Insurgents, American Patriots </i>is the stunning account of the insurgency that led to the nation's founding.</p></p><p><p><b>T. H. Breen</b> is the William Smith Mason Professor of American History at Northwestern University. The author of several works of history, Breen has also written for <i>The New York Times Magazine </i>and the <i>London Review of Books</i>. He lives in Evanston, Illinois.</p><p>&#x201c;Breen elegantly demonstrates how much we miss when our histories are focused principally on the Founding Fathers.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Nicholas Guyatt, The Times Literary Supplement</i></p><p>&#x201c;Generation after generation, students are taught that the Founders inspired a hesitant, though hardy, American populace to reclaim its rights . . . The truth is a good deal messier and more interesting. Historians in our own time--Mr. Breen, Gary B. Nash and Gordon S. Wood, among others--have shifted the emphasis to the common people.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Alan Pell Crawford, The Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;Founding Father John Adams, looking back at the heady and trying days of the American Revolution, famously wrote &#x2018;the Revolution was effected before the war commenced.' T. H. Breen's new history sets out to fill in the detail -- showing that by the time embattled farmers &#x2018;fired the shot heard round the world' in Concord in 1775, the battle had already been joined by tens of thousands of colonials . . . Breen's book shows an energetic and necessarily untidy process of invention on the part of a people, and captures well its improvisatory nature.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Art Winslow, Chicago Tribune</i></p><p>&#x201c;a scholarly, unnerving account of the American Revolution's darker side--the violence, death threats, false rumors, and extremist rhetoric that introduced a new political order&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Caleb Crain, The New Yorker</i></p><p>&#x201c;In this compellingly structured and argued book, T.H. Breen asserts that a <i>de facto</i> nation came into existence between the spring and fall of 1774. It was in these crucial months that the people of the thirteen colonies -- <i>not</i> the Founding Fathers, <i>not</i> the Continental Army, <i>not</i> the maladroit British government -- executed a series of steps that collectively solved problems of governance and demonstrated how a republic could be successfully constituted. What's even more surprising is that Breen makes this somewhat counterintuitive argument, one rooted in a social history sensibility, in the form of a chronological narrative. He achieves this cohesion despite lacking a discrete sense of leading characters or a dramatic set of circumstances (the most consequential event of his story is actually a rumor). The result is a book that's highly readable as well as provocative.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Jim Cullen, History News Network</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>American </i><i>Insurgents, American Patriots</i> is one of the most compelling accounts I've read of how &#x2018;the people' forged the Revolution.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Thomas S. Kidd, Books and Culture</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>American Insurgents, American Patriots</i> is a much-needed corrective to the notion that the Revolution was the product solely of intellectuals and pamphleteers . . . Breen is especially good on reminding us of the passion that the mass of people -- whom he calls &#x2018;insurgents' -- brought to the cause. He traces the role played by newspapers in firing up these rural folks and shows how their readiness to react, sometimes violently, fueled the cause of independence.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Tony Lewis, Providence Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;Casting a wide net in his research to reconstruct the patchwork of grassroots rebellions and self-organized protests across the colonies. Breen is among the growing ranks of historians convincingly uncovering how the Founding Fathers followed and controlled, rather than precipitated, the move toward independence and democracy.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>American History</i></p><p>&#x201c;T. H. Breen's <i>American Insurgents, American Patriots</i> is a pioneering and riveting new analysis of how America was born. Skirting the whole Founding Fathers phenomena, Breen champions instead the everyman of the pre-revolution as a brave citizens' brigade of change. A landmark achievement!&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Douglas Brinkley, Professor of History at Rice University and official CBS News Historian</i></p><p>&#x201c;The Founding Fathers have all the honor they need. Now it's time to honor the ordinary men and women who T. H. Breen brilliantly assays in this riveting book on the crucial run-up to the Declaration of Independence. He shows how people from small farming communities, risking all, purged the countryside of royal officials, dismantled royal authority, shuttered court houses, and defied the King's troops. In this tautly constructed book, Breen shows how much the bewigged Founding Fathers owed to those beneath them, and how much we owe to the plain-spoken, inconspicuous, and roughened colonial insurgents who are the unsung heroes of the American Revolution.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Gary B. Nash, author of The Unknown American Revolution</i></p><p>&#x201c;Who made the American Revolution? Not the men who typically get the most credit for it, says T.H. Breen in <i>American Insurgents, American Patriots</i>. This bracing and impassioned recounting of the origins of America's break with Great Britain puts &#x2018;the people'--ordinary men and women--back into their rightful place in the story. Sure to provoke discussion, Breen's work is a much-needed and welcome addition to the literature on the founding of the American nation.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Annette Gordon-Reed, winner of the Pulitzer Prize</i></p><p>&#x201c;T. H. Breen's revisionist page-turner recaptures the ungentlemanly labors of Colonial America's dangerous classes, those vigilantes, night riders, and terrorists who made the Revolution possible even before Samuel Adams, Patrick Henry, and Thomas Paine proclaimed its necessity. There is sobering contemporary relevance here for Americans about great empires and the violent resistance they spawn in the name of freedom.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>David Levering Lewis, winner of the Pulitzer Prize</i></p><p>&#x201c;In this engaging book, Breen tells the vivid stories of thousands of ordinary Americans who made an extraordinary revolution. <i>American Insurgents, American Patriots</i> reminds us that we have many more Founding Mothers and Fathers than we usually recognize. Breen deftly explores the American Revolution in its full social depth, revealing how it affected everyone: the rich and poor, free and slave, and Patriot and Loyalist.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Alan Taylor, winner of the Pulitzer Prize</i></p><p>&#x201c;Breen has uncovered the grass roots of the American Revolution in the unheralded acts of ordinary people. Meeting in towns and villages throughout the colonies, they gave public notice that they no longer consented to British rule. Without the prompting of the leaders who have figured so largely in standard histories, they established their own independence well before Thomas Jefferson and company declared it in their famous document.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Edmund Morgan, winner of the Pulitzer Prize</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>American Insurgents, American Patriots</i> reveals startling details of the alienation and anger that pervaded the minds of thousands of Americans long before shots were fired on Lexington Green. This is a book that deepens our understanding of the American Revolution--and it's a great read in the bargain!&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Thomas Fleming, author of Washington's Secret War: The Hidden History of Valley Forge</i></p><p>&#x201c;This compelling narrative examines the lives of ordinary Americans who in the years 1774 and 1775 led the way to American independence. The book's great merit is to describe the foundation that an insurgency of common people constructed for the building of a new nation.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Mark A. Noll, Francis A. McAnaney Professor of History, University of Notre Dame</i></p><p>&#x201c;T. H. Breen restores the people to their proper place in our understanding of the coming of the American Revolution. Showing how popular anger at misguided British policies was channeled into political and military action, Breen gives us fresh perspectives on the ways ordinary Americans mobilized themselves for war and helped create a new nation. Beautifully written and powerfully argued, <i>American Insurgents, American Patriots</i> should attract a wide and grateful readership.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Peter S. Onuf, author of Jefferson's Empire: The Language of American Nationhood</i></p><p>&#x201c;Breen's account restores a vivid sense of what the American Revolution felt like to the brave men and women who lived through its enormous ups and downs, and its everyday violence as well. With a scholar's command and a writer's sympathy, he infuses a world of meaning into the word &#x2018;insurgent'-- an apt description for the Americans who were turning the known world upside down.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Ted Widmer, Director and Librarian, John Carter Brown Library</i></p><p>&#x201c;If earlier authors convinced you that Americans owe their independence to a handful of &#x2018;founding brothers,' you will be fascinated by T. H. Breen's persuasive demonstration that the Founders of the republic could not have succeeded--and might not have tried--without support and pressure from tens of thousands of ordinary Patriots who recognized that sometimes leaders need to be led.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Woody Holton, author of Abigail Adams</i></p><p>&#x201c;Casting a new light on the origins of the struggle for independence, Breen mines letters, sermons and diaries to create a lively, nuanced account of ordinary farmers' growing resistance to the British government in the two years before the Declaration of Independence. Angry at oppressive parliamentary acts that abrogated their God-given rights, tens of thousands of rebellious insurgents laid the groundwork for a successful revolution. Their anger was every bit as important to the revolutionary story as the learned debates of the Founding Fathers . . . An important new view of a revolution in the making.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>&#x201c;Breen presents a provocative reinterpretation of the American Revolution as more of a grassroots movement of ordinary persons . . . This is a valuable book by a distinguished scholar.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p></p><h2>The Three Witches</h2><p><p>The three bad witches are HUNGRY! "Let's eat these children," they say. They may have teeth that are longer than their lips and they may wear high heels, but they are NO match for two smart children, their brave grandma, three hound dogs, and a fast-running snake.</p><p><em>The Three Witches</em> was first published in every tongue got to confess, the third volume of folklore collected by Zora Neale Hurston while traveling in the Gulf States in the 1930s.

Grandmother goes for food and the witches come. Those witches! Their teeth were far longer than their lips! They send the children to fetch water in a sieve; the children end up in a tree, and the witches start to chop it down with broad axes. The girl sings Block eye, chip! and the wood chips fly back into the witches' eyes and blind them. The boy calls the dogs, but they are tied up at home. Grandma returns, but is so tired from her journey that she takes a nap. A snake wakes up the old woman, she looses the dogs, and all ends well. Thomas's adaptation of the tale is careful and clever&#x2013;she doesn't leave out anything, and elaborates only by drawing engaging dialogue out of the more straightforward original narrative. Ringgold's naive-style paintings in dark rich hues suit the creepy story perfectly&#x2013;boy, are those witches ugly! Her portrait of Hurston, laughing, at the end of the story, lends a lovely and reassuring visual coda. Short engaging notes add context and cite Hurston's original source.

What did these and other high-growth companies do to achieve such a goal? What blueprint do they follow to produce such results? Based on three years of in-depth research, David Thomson's Blueprint to a Billion approach provides the first quantitative assessment of the success pattern common across a distinct group of 387 "blueprint companies"&#x2014;the 5% that have IPO'd since 1980 and grown to $1 billion in revenue. They represent America's highest growth companies; they uniquely achieved exponential revenue growth and returns. <p>This book is not about one unique company, its innovation, and the financial returns it achieved; it's about the quantifiable, success-based pattern&#x2014;independent of economic cycles or industries&#x2014;shared across this group of 387 elite companies. It's about how you can use seven common essentials to better your business, organization, team, or yourself and produce exponential growth. It's about executing the essentials and linking them. It's about taking the actions that matter while avoiding pitfalls. The 7 essentials explored are:</p> <p>Essential #1: Create and Sustain a Breakthrough Value Proposition</p> <p>Essential#2: Exploit a High-Growth Market Segment</p> <p>Essential #3: Marquee Customers Shape the Revenue Powerhouse</p> <p>Essential #4: Leverage Big Brother Alliances for Breaking into New Markets</p> <p>Essential #5: Become the Masters of Exponential Returns</p> <p>Essential #6: The Management Team: Inside-Outside Leadership</p> <p>Essential #7: The Board: Comprised of Essentials Experts</p> <p>Divided into three comprehensive sections, Blueprint to a Billion will show you how to formulate a breakthrough value proposition, create exponential revenue growth&#x2014;the most valuable and unique kind of growth&#x2014;and seize the opportunity to garner exponential returns. More importantly, it provides practical guidelines that you, as a business leader at any level, can use to improve company performance from one year to the next. While the book is based on quantitative evidence, it provides insightful analysis and very personal stories from many blueprint company leaders.</p> <p>Both fact-based and actionable, Blueprint to a Billion contains fresh research that provides valuable insights into success-based business building. Adopting and executing one or more essentials will maximize your growth&#x2014;both personally and corporately. Executing all 7 essentials will enable your company to achieve unprecedented exponential growth.</p>DAVID G.

Sheridan's thoughtful analysis and lively interpretation of the people and events shaping the Grand Canyon State, <i>Arizona</i> has become a standard in the field. Now, just in time for Arizona's centennial, Sheridan has revised and expanded this already top-tier state history to incorporate events and changes that have taken place in recent years. Addressing contemporary issues like land use, water rights, dramatic population increases, suburban sprawl, and the US-Mexico border, the new material makes the book more essential than ever. It successfully places the forty-eighth state's history within the context of national and global events. No other book on Arizona history is as integrative or comprehensive.</p><p>From stone spear points more than 10,000 years old to the boom and bust of the housing market in the first decade of this century, <i>Arizona: A History </i>explores the ways in which Native Americans, Hispanics, African Americans, Asians, and Anglos have inhabited and exploited Arizona. Sheridan, a life-long resident of the state, puts forth new ideas about what a history should be, embracing a holistic view of the region and shattering the artificial line between prehistory and history. Other works on Arizona's history focus on government, business, or natural resources, but this is the only book to meld the ethnic and cultural complexities of the state's history into the main flow of the story.</p><p>A must read for anyone interested in Arizona's past or present, this extensive revision of the classic work will appeal to students, scholars, and general readers alike.</p></p><p>Thomas E. Sheridan has spent a lifetime in Arizona, "living off it and seeking refuge from it." He knows firsthand its canyons, forests, and deserts; he has seen its cities exploding with new growth; and, like many other people, he sometimes fears for its future. <br> In this book, Sheridan sets forth new ideas about what a history should be. "Arizona: A History" explores the ways in which Native Americans, Hispanics, and Anglos have inhabited and exploited Arizona from the pursuit of the Naco mammoth 11,000 years ago to the financial adventurism of Charles Keating and others today. It also examines how perceptions of Arizona have changed, creating new constituencies of tourists, environmentalists, and outside business interests to challenge the dominance of ranchers, mining companies, and farmers who used to control the state. Sheridan emphasizes the crucial role of the federal government in Arizona's development throughout the book. <br> As Sheridan writes about the past, his eyes are on the inevitable change and compromise of the present and future. He balances the gains and losses as global forces interact more and more with local cultural and environmental factors.<p>Thomas E. Sheridan is a research anthropologist at the Southwest Center and a professor at the School of Anthropology at the University of Arizona. He is the author of twelve books including <i>Los Tucsonenses: The Mexican Community of Tucson, 1854-1941</i>, and <i>Landscapes of Fraud: Mission Tumacacori, the Baca Float, and the Betrayal of the O&#x2019;odham</i>, both published by the University of Arizona Press.</p></p><h2>A History of the World&#39;s Religions</h2><p><p><b>For courses in History of World Religions or Introduction to World Religions.</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><i>A History of the World's Religions gives students an accurate look at the religions of the world by including descriptive and interpretive details from the original source materials, and to bridge the interval between the founding of religions and their present state.</i></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Refined by over forty years of dialogue and correspondence with religious experts and practitioners around the world, Noss's <i>A History of the World's Religions </i>is widely regarded as the hallmark of scholarship, fairness, and accuracy in its field.

Visit FasterThanNormal.com.Chapter One<br><br> An Introduction to the World of Attention Deficit . . . Ooh! Shiny!<br><br> Hi, I'm Peter Shankman. I'm the most ADHD person you're ever going to meet. But I'm also really, really proud of that. My ADHD is responsible for the majority of my success, and I've had a little bit of success. I've started and successfully sold three companies, the most well-known of which is called Help a Reporter Out (or HARO), which singlehandedly changed how journalists around the world find their sources and how companies and regular people get into the media. I'm also a worldwide keynote speaker, spending the majority of my time on an airplane to give keynote talks to major companies across the globe, including American Express, Disney, Huawei, Starwood Hotels, and hundreds of others. I host one of the top podcasts on ADD and ADHD, called (duh) Faster Than Normal. I run an online entrepreneurial community of more than three hundred people called ShankMinds. I've written four business books, including two bestsellers. I built a top-selling video course on ADHD, called the FTN Course. I go on TV a lot, including CNN, Fox, Bloomberg, and CNBC, talking about marketing, advertising, business, and the customer economy. I'm an Ironman Triathlete, a "B" licensed skydiver with more than four hundred jumps, and possibly most important, a dad to an amazing four-year-old daughter.<br><br> I've also been diagnosed with ADHD three times, have a very addictive personality, and wake up every single morning sure that today will be the day I'm found out to be nothing more than a fraud who's never done anything good in his life. I've blown countless past relationships because I didn't know how to slow down and match the life-speed of my partner, I've had some spectacular failures, both professionally and personally, and for whatever this is worth, I've cried at more than 70 percent of all episodes of The West Wing.<br><br> While you're reading this book, look for the word "SQUIRREL!" Why? Because I get it-I'm ADHD. I know that books in general are occasionally hard to read-not because we don't like reading, but because sitting through sixty thousand words can, at times, make us want to do anything else. Again: I get it. That's why I'm going to use the term "SQUIRREL!" When you see "SQUIRREL!" it means that I'm saying something even more useful than everything else. It'll be something small, it'll be something tweetable or great for posting on Facebook, it'll be something you'll want to highlight and share with people, it'll be a quick tip that can truly change your life. So keep an eye out for "SQUIRREL!" They're essentially the Cliff's Notes of this book.<br><br> Needless to say, an introduction like that doesn't get me very many matches at speed-dating events.<br><br> If you're reading this and you don't have ADHD-or maybe you've never been diagnosed-or you know friends or family or loved ones who do-keep reading. One of the beauties of this book is that it's also for everyone-not just those with ADHD. Those without it are going to learn just as much (if not more) from the tips, tricks, and hacks that I lay down here. Trust me-you'll get three hours a day back in your life, just for starters.<br><br> If you do have ADHD, though, some of the stories here will be incredibly familiar to you, I have no doubt. Like sitting in my dorm room at Boston University two days into my freshman year, asking myself why I simply couldn't shut up every once in a while, because I'd just blurted out something that I thought was funny, but no one else in the room did, and I was sure I'd just blown the next four years of my social life.<br><br> Or perhaps the frequent trips to the principal's office in grade school, where one of my parents would come collect me after school, and each meeting would start with "If he only applied himself . . ."<br><br> Maybe you might relate to the constant "WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?" looks that I would get every time I had a new or (in my mind, anyway) amazing idea, after I presented it to my bosses, or even to people who I thought loved me. (Definitely one of the reasons I went out on my own professionally, that's for sure.)<br><br> During my time researching this book, and doing all of the homework for it, I've run into countless similar stories from people I've met, those whom I've interviewed on the podcast, and others who have e-mailed me out of the blue to say "I can relate."<br><br> Do any of these scenarios make any sense to you?<br><br> After getting a note from the dean of students in my son's bag six times in two weeks, I called the dean up and asked him point-blank, "Can you tell me if there is anything my son is doing right lately?"<br><br> If I get into the office super early and work before anyone else shows up, I'm so much more productive. The second the office fills with people, it's like my brain shuts down and I start spacing out.<br><br> I finally had to explain to my boss that I needed a half hour in the middle of the day to go exercise, or I'd be useless to him for the remainder of the day. Once I got that and he understood why, my productivity went through the roof, and I've been named "Employee of the Month" three times in the past four months!<br><br> <i>SQUIRREL!: Here's what matters more than anything: You're not broken. You're not damaged, you're not defective, and you're not destroyed. You're not on the island of misfit toys, and your life isn't "wrong" because you've been diagnosed with ADHD.</i><br><br> In fact, I hate that term "diagnosed." You get "diagnosed" with a disease that can hurt you, one that can kill you. You don't get "diagnosed" for good things. No one has ever been "diagnosed" as a lottery winner, or "diagnosed" as stunning enough to win a beauty pageant.<br><br> So the first rule here is this: you're never allowed to say "diagnosed with ADHD" again, because ADHD is not a negative. Say it with me: ADHD is not a negative! Quite the opposite. You're gifted with a brain that's faster than normal, and in this book, we're going to learn how to operate it to its maximum potential. It's going to be awesome.</p><h2>Positive Leadership: Strategies for Extraordinary Performance</h2><p>NEW EDITION, REVISED AND UPDATED<br><br> Beyond Success<br><br> Positive Leadership shows how to reach beyond ordinary success to achieve extraordinary effectiveness, spectacular results, and what Kim Cameron calls &#x201c;positively deviant performance&#x201d;&#x2014;performance far above the norm. Citing a wide range of research in organizational behavior, medical science, and psychology as well as real-world examples, Cameron shows that to achieve exceptional success, leaders must emphasize strengths rather than simply focus on weaknesses; foster virtuous actions such as compassion, gratitude, and forgiveness; encourage contribution goals in addition to achievement goals; and enable meaningfulness in work. In this concise, inspiring, and practical guide, Cameron describes four positive leadership strategies, lays out a proven process for implementing them, and includes a self-assessment instrument. This second edition has been updated throughout with new research findings and new ideas for implementing positive leadership.</p><p>Kim Cameron is William Russell Kelly Professor of Management and Organizations at the University of Michigan and cofounder of the Center for Positive Organizational Scholarship. He is coauthor or co-editor of fourteen books, including Developing Management Skills, Positive Organizational Scholarship, and Making the Impossible Possible.CHAPTER <br>1 <br>Positive Leadership <br>As of this writing, more than 70,000 books on leadership are currently in print. Why would anyone want to produce one more? It is because the vast majority of these leadership books are based on the prescriptions of celebrated leaders recounting their own experiences, convenience samples of people&#x2019;s opinions, or storytellers&#x2019; recitations of inspirational examples. This book is different. It relies wholly on strategies that have been validated by empirical research. It explains the practical approaches to leadership that have emerged from social science research. Because these strategies are not commonly practiced, this book provides some unusual but pragmatic strategies for leaders who want to markedly improve their effectiveness. <br>This book introduces the concept of positive leadership, or the ways in which leaders enable positively deviant performance, foster an affirmative orientation in organizations, and engender a focus on virtuousness and the best of the human condition. Positive leadership applies positive principles arising from the newly emerging fields of positive organizational scholarship (Cameron, Dutton, &amp; Quinn, 2003; Cameron &amp; Spreitzer, 2012), positive psychology (Seligman, 1999), and positive change (Cooperrider &amp; Sriv-astva, 1987). It helps answer the question &#x201c;So what can I do if I want to become a more positive leader?&#x201d; <br>Positive leadership emphasizes what elevates individuals and organizations (in addition to what challenges them), what goes right in organizations (in addition to what goes wrong), what is life-giving (in addition to what is problematic or life-depleting), what is experienced as good (in addition to what is objectionable), what is extraordinary (in addition to what is merely effective), and what is inspiring (in addition to what is difficult or arduous). It promotes outcomes such as thriving at work, interpersonal flourishing, virtuous behaviors, positive emotions, and energizing networks. In this book the focus is primarily on the role of positive leaders in enabling positively deviant performance. <br>To be more specific, positive leadership emphasizes three different orientations: <br>(1) It stresses the facilitation of positively deviant performance, or an emphasis on outcomes that dramatically exceed common or expected performance. Facilitating positive deviance is not the same as achieving ordinary success (such as profitability or effectiveness); rather, positive deviance represents &#x201c;intentional behaviors that depart from the norm of a reference group in honorable ways&#x201d; (Spreitzer &amp; Sonenshein, 2003: 209). Positive leadership aims to help individuals and organizations attain spectacular levels of achievement. <br>(2) It emphasizes an affirmative bias, or a focus on strengths and capabilities and on affirming human potential (Buckingham &amp; Clifton, 2001). Its orientation is toward enabling thriving and flourishing at least as much as addressing obstacles and impediments. Without being Pollyannaish, it stresses positive communication, optimism, and strengths, as well as the value and opportunity embedded in problems and weaknesses. <br>Positive leadership does not ignore negative events and, in fact, acknowledges the importance of the negative in producing extraordinary outcomes. Difficulties and adverse occurrences often stimulate positive outcomes that would never occur otherwise. Being a positive leader is not the same as merely being nice, charismatic, trustworthy, or a servant leader (Conger, 1989; Greenleaf, 1977). Rather, it incorporates these attributes and supplements them with a focus on strategies that provide strengths-based, positive energy to individuals and organizations. <br>(3) The third connotation emphasizes facilitating the best of the human condition, or a focus on virtuousness (Cameron &amp; Caza, 2004; Spreitzer &amp; Sonenshein, 2003). Positive leadership is based on a eudaemonistic assumption; that is, an inclination exists in all human systems toward goodness for its intrinsic value (Aristotle, Metaphysics XII; Dutton &amp; Sonenshein, 2007). Whereas there has been some debate regarding what constitutes goodness and whether universal human virtues can be identified, all societies and cultures possess catalogs of traits they deem virtuous (Dent, 1984; Peterson &amp; Seligman, 2004). Positive leadership is oriented toward developing what Aristotle labeled goods of first intent, or to &#x201c;that which is good in itself and is to be chosen for its own sake&#x201d; (Aristotle, Metaphysics XII: 3). An orientation exists, in other words, toward fostering virtuousness in individuals and organizations. <br>CRITICISMS AND CONCERNS <br> <br>To be fair, some are very skeptical of an emphasis on positive leadership. They claim that a focus on the positive is &#x201c;saccharine and Pollyannaish,&#x201d; &#x201c;ethnocentric and representing a Western bias,&#x201d; &#x201c;ignorant of negative phenomena,&#x201d; &#x201c;elitist,&#x201d; &#x201c;mitigates against hard work and invites unpre-paredness,&#x201d; &#x201c;leads to reckless optimism,&#x201d; &#x201c;represents a narrow moral agenda,&#x201d; and even &#x201c;produces delusional thinking&#x201d; (see Ehrenreich, 2009; Fineman, 2006; George, 2004; Hackman, 2008). They imply that it represents a new age opiate in the face of escalating challenges. One author maintains that not only is there little evidence that posi-tivity is beneficial but, in fact, it is harmful to organizations (Ehrenreich, 2009). <br>This book aims to provide the evidence that the reverse is actually true. Positive leadership makes a positive difference. The positive strategies described here are universal across cultures. Cultural differences may alter the manner in which these strategies are implemented, but evidence suggests that the strategies themselves are universal in their effects. They exemplify a heliotropic effect&#x2014;or an inclination in all living systems toward positive, life-giving forces. They have practical utility in difficult circumstances as much as in benevolent circumstances. <br>Far from mitigating against hard work or representing soft, simple, and syrupy actions, these strategies require effort, elevated standards, and genuine competence. The strategies represent pragmatic, validated levers available to leaders so that they can achieve positive performance in organizations and in individuals. The empirical evidence presented in the chapters that follow is offered to support this conclusion. <br>AN EXAMPLE OF POSITIVE DEVIANCE <br>An easy way to identify positive leadership is to observe positive deviance. An example of such performance is illustrated by the cleanup and closure of the Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Production Facility near Denver, Colorado (Cameron &amp; Lavine, 2006). At the time the facility was rife with conflict and antagonism. It had been raided and temporarily closed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1989 for alleged violations of environmental laws, and employee grievances had skyrocketed. More than 100 tons of radioactive plutonium were on site, and more than 250,000 cubic meters of low-level radioactive waste were being stored in temporary drums on the prairie. Broad public sentiment regarded the facility as a danger to surrounding communities, and demonstrations by multiple groups had been staged there from the 1960s through the 1980s in protest of nuclear proliferation and potential radioactive pollution. In fact, radioactive pollution levels were estimated to be so high that a 1994 ABC Nightline broadcast labeled two buildings on the site the most dangerous buildings in America. <br>The Department of Energy estimated that closing and cleaning up the facility would require a minimum of 70 years and cost more than $36 billion. A Denver, Colorado, engineering and environmental firm&#x2014;CH2MHILL&#x2014;won the contract to clean up and close the 6,000-acre site consisting of 800 buildings. <br>CH2MHILL completed the assignment 60 years ahead of schedule, $30 billion under budget, and 13 times cleaner than required by federal standards. Antagonists such as citizen action groups, community councils, and state regulators changed from being adversaries and protesters to advocates, lobbyists, and partners. Labor relations among the three unions (i.e., steelworkers, security guards, building trades) improved from 900 grievances to the best in the steelworker president&#x2019;s work life. A culture of lifelong employment and employee entitlement was replaced by a workforce that enthusiastically worked itself out of a job as quickly as possible. Safety performance exceeded federal standards by twofold and more than 200 technological innovations were produced in the service of faster and safer performance. <br>These achievements far exceeded every knowledgeable expert&#x2019;s predictions of performance. They were, in short, a quintessential example of positive deviance achieved by positive leadership. The U.S. Department of Energy attributed positive leadership, in fact, as a key factor in accounting for this dramatic success (see Cameron &amp; Lavine, 2006: 77). <br>Of course, for positive leaders to focus on positive deviance does not mean that they ignore nonpositive conditions or situations where mistakes, crises, deterioration, or problems are present. Most of the time people and organizations fall short of achieving the best they can be or fail to fulfill their optimal potential. Many positive outcomes are stimulated by trials and difficulties; for example, demonstrated courage, resilience, forgiveness, and compassion are relevant only in the context of negative events. As illustrated by the Rocky Flats example, some of the best of human and organizational attributes are revealed only when confronting obstacles, challenges, or detrimental circumstances. Common human experience, as well as abundant scientific evidence, supports the idea that negativity has a place in human flourishing (Cameron, 2008). Negative news sells more than positive news, people are affected more by negative feedback than positive feedback, and traumatic events have a greater impact on humans than positive events....</p><h2>Band Theory and Electronic Properties of Solids (Oxford Master Series in Physics)</h2><p>This latest text in the new <em>Oxford Master Series in Physics</em> provides a much need introduction to band theory and the electronic properties of materials.

Freund&#39;s Mathematical Statistics with Applications (7th Edition)</h2><p><p> <b> </b> This classic, calculus-based introduction to the theory and application of statistics provides an unusually comprehensive depth and breadth of coverage and reflects the latest in statistical thinking and current practices. <b> </b> New to this edition is the addition of an applications section at the end of each chapter that deals with the theory presented. Further emphasis has been placed on the use of computers in performing statistical calculations. Topics covered include probability distributions and densities, random variables, sampling distributions, hypothesis testing, regression and correlation, variance, and more. <b> </b> An excellent reference work for professional statisticians in a variety of fields. </p></p><p><p> The seventh edition of John E. Freund's Mathematical Statistics, like the first six editions, is designed primarily for a two-semester or a three-quarter calculus-based introduction to the mathematics of statistics. It can used, however, for a single-semester course, emphasizing probability, probability distributions and densities, sampling, and classical statistical inference. For this purpose, the authors recommend that the course be based on Chapters 1-6, 8, 11, and 13. In addition, Sections 2.8, 4.8, 5.8, 5.9, 6.7, 8.7, and 13.8 may be omitted. In teaching this abbreviated course, the instructor may facilitate fitting the material into the time allotted by choosing several other sections to de-emphasize. </p> <p> The major departure in this edition is the addition of a section at the end of each chapter, called "The Theory in Practice," and dealing in greater depth with some of the applications of the theory. The applied exercises in each chapter have been grouped together at the end of this new section. Subheadings have been supplied to indicate which exercises go with which section or sections to aid the instructor in assigning homework exercises. </p> <p> Many students taking this course are experiencing the ideas of statistics for the first time. It is believed that it will be helpful for them to spend some time learning how the mathematical ideas of statistics carry over into the world of applications. To emphasize this new treatment, the authors have added "with Applications" to the title of the text. In addition, further emphasis has been placed on the use of computers in performing statistical calculations. Several new exercises have been added, many of which require the use of a computer. New material has been added to Chapter 15, placing additional emphasis on experimental design and factorial experiments. </p> <p> We would like to express our appreciation to the Robert E.

The book explores the various expressive arts therapy modalities both individually and in relationship to each other. The contributors emphasize the importance of the imagination and of aesthetic experience, arguing that these are central to psychological well-being, and challenging accepted views which place primary emphasis on the cognitive and emotional dimensions of mental health and development. <br>Part One explores the theory which informs the practice of expressive arts therapy. Part Two relates this theory to the therapeutic application of the expressive arts (including music, art, movement, drama, poetry and voicework) in different contexts, ranging from play therapy with children to trauma work with Bosnian refugees and second-generation Holocaust survivors. Comprehensive in its coverage of the most fundamental aspects of expressive arts therapy, this book is a significant contribution to the field and a useful reference for all practitioners.</p></p><p>Stephen K.

One cannot contemplate modern history without considering the role of the British Empire. The Cambridge Illustrated History of the British Empire is an illuminating survey of the development and impact of the British Empire from the end of the American Revolution to the present day. Against a background of striking illustrations, twelve experts on imperial history survey the experience of colonialism in North America, the Caribbean, India, Africa, Australia, the Middle East, and Asia. They emphasize social and cultural history: the movement of peoples, including slavery, and of ideas, including Christianity, art, and literature; the development of trade, transport, and urban life; the impact of imperialism on food, dress, and recreation; and the emergence of new national identities. Imperialism can be a contentious issue. While not seeking to avoid controversial topics, The Cambridge Illustrated History of the British Empire is by no means a nostalgic look at a bygone era. It is a lively document chronicling an important part of our cultural history. It will be of wide interest to history enthusiasts, students, and scholars alike.</p><p>Another handsome volume from a distinguished series, the <i>Cambridge Illustrated History of the British Empire</i> begins its narrative after the American colonies achieved their independence and continues to the present. Spending anywhere from a few minutes to many hours with this book reminds us of how a 19th-century global superpower shaped so much of the modern world. Among its many colorful side bars are histories of Australia's convict origins, the city-state of Hong Kong, and the Suez Canal. An appropriate picture enriches the text on nearly every page.Through striking illustrations and a text written by leading experts, this book examines the experience of British colonialism in North America, India, Africa, Australia, and the Caribbean, as well as the impact of the empire on Britain itself. Emphasis is placed on social and cultural history, including slavery, trade, religion, art, and the movement of ideas. <li>Thematic approach tacklin controversial issues directly and responsibly</li><li>Condensed history British imperial territories, further reading and index</li><li>Special boxes on key aspects of the subject</li><li>Superb illustration and an authoritative, accessible text</li></p><h2>Agnes Grey (Wordsworth Classics)</h2><p>With a specially commissioned Introduction and Notes by Kathryn White, Assistant Curator/Librarian of the Bront� Museum, Haworth, Yorkshire This novel is a trenchant expose of the frequently isolated, intellectually stagnant and emotionally-starved conditions under which many governesses worked in the mid-19th century. This is a deeply personal novel written from the author&#39;s own experience and as such Agnes Grey has a power and poignancy which mark it out as a landmark work of literature dealing with the social and moral evolution of English society during the last century.</p><p>This book is in Electronic Paperback Format.

Unfortunately, Agnes cannot anticipate the hardship, humiliation, and loneliness that await her in the brutish Bloomfield and haughty Murray households. Drawn from Anne Bronte&#39;s own experiences, &#34;Agnes Grey depicts the harsh conditions and class snobbery that governesses were often forced to endure. As Barbara A. Suess writes in her Introduction, &#34;Bronte provides a portrait of the governess that is as sympathetic as her fictional indictment of the shallow, selfish moneyed class is biting.&#34;</p><h2>Schaum&#39;s Outline of Linear Algebra</h2><p><p>This third edition of the successful outline in linear algebra--which sold more than 400,000 copies in its past two editions--has been thoroughly updated to increase its applicability to the fields in which linear algebra is now essential: computer science, engineering, mathematics, physics, and quantitative analysis.

Only Dickens can give us nightmare and daydream together. <br><br>According to George Orwell, &#x201c;in <i>Oliver Twist...</i>Dickens attacked English institutions with a ferocity that has never since been approached. Yet he managed to do it without making himself hated, and, more than this, the very people he attacked have welcomed him so completely that he has become a national institution himself.&#x201d;<br><br><b>With an Introduction by Frederick Busch</b><br><b>and an Afterword by Edward Le Comte</b></p><p>10 1.5-hour cassettes<p>Starved and mistreated, empty bowl in hand, the young hero musters the courage to approach his master, saying, "Please, sir, I want some more." Oliver Twist's famous cry of the heart has resounded with readers since the novel's initial appearance in 1837, and the book remains a popular favorite with fans of all ages.<br>Dickens was no stranger to the pain of hunger and the degradation of poverty. He poured his own youthful experience of Victorian London's unspeakable squalor into this realistic depiction of the link between destitution and crime. Oliver escapes his miserable servitude by running away to London, where he unwillingly but inevitably joins a scabrous gang of thieves. Masterminded by the loathsome Fagin, the underworld crew features some of Dickens' most memorable characters, including the juvenile pickpocket known as the Artful Dodger, the vicious Bill Sikes, and gentle Nancy, an angel of self-sacrifice.<br>A profound social critic, Dickens introduced genteel readers to the problems of the poor in a way that had rarely been attempted before. This tale of the struggle between hope and cruelty continues to speak to modern audiences.</p></p><h2>Essentials of Psychiatric Diagnosis, First Edition: Responding to the Challenge of DSM-5�</h2><p>Grounded in author Allen Frances&#39;s extensive clinical experience, this comprehensive yet concise guide helps the busy clinician find the right psychiatric diagnosis and avoid the many pitfalls that lead to errors. Covering every disorder routinely encountered in clinical practice, Frances provides the appropriate ICD-9-CM code for each one (the same code utilized in the DSM), a useful screening question, a colorful descriptive prototype, lucid diagnostic tips, and a discussion of other disorders that must be ruled out. The book closes with an index of the most common presenting symptoms, listing possible diagnoses that must be considered for each. Frances was instrumental in the development of past editions of the DSM and provides helpful cautions on questionable aspects of DSM-5.</p><p><p> Allen Frances, MD, is a clinician, educator, researcher, and leading authority on psychiatric diagnosis. He chaired the DSM-IV Task Force, was a member of the Task Force that prepared DSM-III-R, and wrote the final version of the Personality Disorders section in DSM-III.

He is an active blogger for <i>The Huffington Post</i>, <i>Psychology Today</i>, and <i>Education Update.</i></p><br><p>"<i>Essentials of Psychiatric Diagnosis</i> is simply the best book I&#x2019;ve read about how to accurately diagnose your patients. Frances's combination of vast experience, down-in-the-trenches common sense, and informed skepticism is unique. Whether you&#x2019;re a psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, nurse, crisis counselor, or any other mental health professional, you should buy this book, read it cover to cover initially, and then keep it in your office to refer back to frequently. I&#x2019;m glad this book had not been published before I wrote my book on the psychiatric interview, because the competition would have made me choose a different topic!"--Daniel J. Carlat, MD, Department of Psychiatry, Tufts University School of Medicine; Founding Editor, <i>The Carlat Psychiatry Report<br></i><br>"With his clinical expertise, leadership roles in prior DSM editions, and healthy skepticism about overdiagnosis and excessive medication, Frances has crafted a clinical gem. This clear and concise book describes a sequential assessment process and provides screening questions, easily remembered prototypic descriptions, differential diagnostic considerations, and cautionary notes about diagnostic traps. Frances recognizes the need for a diagnosis to guide intervention, while steering clear of diagnostic reification. All clinicians need this book for frequent reference, and it should be a required text in mental health training programs."--John F. Clarkin, PhD, Personality Disorders Institute, New York Presbyterian Hospital; Department of Psychiatry, Weill Cornell Medical College<br><br>"This easy-to-read, commonsensical handbook guides mental health clinicians through the thicket of differential diagnosis in psychiatry. Frances--a thoughtful and effective critic of the excesses of DSM-5--shows where diagnosis is valid and essential, and where a premature diagnosis or a diagnostic fad has the potential to hurt patients. Everyone who uses diagnosis in daily practice will benefit from the down-to-earth wisdom of this book."--Joel Paris, MD, Department of Psychiatry, McGill University, Canada&nbsp;<br><br>"A 'must have' for mental health professionals. Frances provides useful, easy-to-understand information about psychiatric diagnosis and coding for clinicians in all mental health disciplines."--K. Dayle Jones, PhD, LMHC, Mental Health Counseling Program, University of Central Florida<br><br>"Frances demonstrates an unusual ability to communicate the tacit knowledge of an expert into understandable concepts and ideas that will be appreciated by clinicians and students alike. Elegantly simple screening questions precede each disorder and cut through the diagnostic murk. Facilitating patient-centered care, teamwork, and collaboration, this is a comprehensive diagnostic resource for the whole treatment team."--Margaret (Peggy) Halter, PhD, APRN, Editor, <i>Foundations of Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing;</i> Associate Dean, Dwight Schar College of Nursing and Health Sciences, Ashland University<br><br>"This volume should head the list of user-friendly guides to psychiatric diagnosis. Frances draws on his considerable experience and contributions, such as heading the DSM-IV Task Force, to produce a work that will be indispensable for primary care clinicians and all professionals and students in mental health care. The guide contains screening questions, prototypic case descriptions, ICD-9-CM codes, and specific cautionary statements to reduce diagnostic inflation and raise concerns about aspects of DSM-5. The material is handled with sensitivity and compassion, with the patient's best interests always the central consideration. This book is a welcome arrival at a time when recent trends in diagnosis are increasingly attracting controversy. I will be using this excellent guide in my own work and will recommend it to my students and colleagues."--Adrian Wells, PhD, Division of Clinical Psychology, University of Manchester, United Kingdom<br><br>"Anyone who brings a critical perspective to psychiatric diagnosis will welcome this book's truly refreshing, reader-friendly approach. Frances, a well-known, respected psychiatrist, offers up what is clearly a lifetime synthesis of wisdom and knowledge on diagnosis. Rejecting the cumbersome detailing of esoteric diagnostic criteria found elsewhere, Frances presents a simpler, consumable structure for readers. Importantly, he includes specific DSM-5-related cautions and caveats. Social workers will appreciate that Frances begins discussion of the diagnostic interview with a section called 'The Relationship Comes First'--and that he argues the client should actually be part of the diagnostic team. This is good stuff."--Kia J. Bentley, PhD, LCSW, School of Social Work, Virginia Commonwealth University</p><p>"This uncluttered, visually appealing guide will assist all primary care physicians in the care of patients with psychiatric illnesses."--Elizabeth S. White, MD, internist, Settlement Health, New York City</p></p><h2>Mathematics and the Imagination</h2><p>Emphasizes the approach to mathematics rather than an explanation of the hows and whys of the subject. The author argues that maths is analogous to a fairyland ruled by logic, and that the only restraint on what math can provide is the reader&#39;s lack of imagination in using its principles.</p><p></p><h2>The Professor (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>The hero of Charlotte Bront�'s first novel escapes a dreary clerkship in industrial Yorkshire by taking a job as a teacher in Belgium. There, however, his entanglement with the sensuous but manipulative Zora�de Reuter, complicates his affections for a penniless girl who is both teacher and pupil in Reuter's school. Also included in this edition is <em>Emma</em>, Charlotte Bront�'s last, unfinished novel. Both works are drawn from the original Clarendon texts.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.<br></p><p>The Professor was the first novel that Charlotte Bront� completed. Rejected by the publisher who took on the work of her sisters in 1846--Anne's Agnes Grey and Emily's Wuthering Heights--it remained unpublished until 1857, two years after Charlotte Bront�'s death. Like Villette (1853), The Professor is based on her experiences as a language student in Brussels in 1842. Told from the point of view of William Crimsworth, the only male narrator that she used, the work formulated a new aesthetic that questioned many of the presuppositions of Victorian society. Bront�'s hero escapes from a humiliating clerkship in a Yorkshire mill to find work as a teacher in Belgium, where he falls in love with an impoverished student-teacher, who is perhaps the author's most realistic feminist heroine. The Professor endures today as both a harbinger of Bront�'s later novels and a compelling read in its own right.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The middle and latter portion of The Professor is as good as I can write," proclaimed Bront�. "It contains more pith, more substance, more reality, in my judgment, than much of Jane Eyre."<br>The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. It provided the foun-dation for their next publishing venture, Random House. The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with affordable hard-bound editions of important works of liter-ature and thought. For the Modern Library's seventy-fifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoring as its emblem the running torchbearer created by Lucian Bernhard in 1925 and refurbishing jackets, bindings, and type, as well as inau-gurating a new program of selecting titles. The Modern Library continues to provide the world's best books, at the best prices.Celebrated British authoress, Charlotte Bronte is best-known for her novels which have achieved the status of world-famous classics.

A former Liberal Democratic Party shogun, Ozawa became an influential member of the upstart coalition that wrested power from the LDP last year. Aware that his economically formidable country faces a host of new challenges in the postCold War era, he offers a series of proposals at once parochial and visionary for making parliamentary government more accountable, responsive, and responsible on the home front, less hesitant in the wider world. To facilitate effective government action, for example, he would give local authorities greater autonomy, nurture a genuinely competitive two-party system, reform campaign finance, and redraw the electoral map. Noting that the industrious populace has derived precious little improvement in its standard of living from Dai Nihon's prosperity, Ozawa goes FDR one better in stumping for five freedoms (from teeming urban centers, corporate tyranny, overwork, ageism/sexism, and petty regulation). He advocates a shakeup in the nation's rigid educational methods to encourage students to think for themselves in order to help Japanese companies remain innovative players in the global marketplace. Ozawa also calls on Tokyo to become a high-profile source of foreign aid that sets the pace in environmental matters--a worthy ambition for a resource- poor nation that leads the league in slaughtering dolphins and whales. Senator Jay Rockefeller's pious introduction takes no note of such contradictions. Whether Ozawa's deadly earnest call for his fellow Japanese to create a more open society can gain a broad-based readership in the West is an open question. For certain, however, his grand design is in the self-interested tradition of an insular nation-state whose capacity to adapt has not been in serious doubt since the Meiji Restoration.

It also famously contained not a single work by a female artist and devoted a scant eight pages to non-Western art. Five editions and three decades later, the art history student's Stone Age-to-20th-century Bible has swelled into a massive, slipcased, 1,000-page tome studded with 865 color reproductions and subheadings that corral individual artists whose achievements used to flow together like some mighty art historical river. <p> Women artists (from 17th-century painter Artemisia Gentileschi to contemporary photographer Cindy Sherman) now make the cut, and the focus is purely Western, extended to include 20th-century photography and postmodernism (with a scant two pages on postmodern theory). The timeline charting landmarks in art alongside key events in history, science, and the arts has been handsomely redesigned. Each historical period now has its own world map and selection of excerpts from primary sources (including unusual ones, like a fellow monk's account of painter Hugo van der Goes's mental troubles). </p><p> With each edition, portions of the text have been altered to reflect shifting scholarly interpretations. (As the late H.W. Janson wryly noted in the original, 1962 preface, "There are no 'plain facts' in the history of art.") H.W.'s son Anthony writes in his preface to the sixth edition that changes have been made to sections on ancient art; French romantic, realist, and impressionist painting; and the history of Western architecture. Happily unchanged--no dumbing-down here--is the clarity and intelligence of the writing. All in all, <i>History of Art</i> remains an invaluable reference for anyone who studies or writes about the subject. But even if no further bloat is contemplated, the time has come to rename the worthy Janson <i>History of Western Art</i>, and to divide it into two volumes, if only to protect the health and backpacks of art historians-to-be. <i>--Cathy Curtis</i></p>The definitive survey of the Western Art tradition-the standard to which all other art history surveys are compared--this classic text uses an exceptional art program, impeccable scholarship, gorgeous color pictures, and an unmatched student-friendly pedagogy to introduce readers to the vast world of Western painting, sculpture, architecture, photography, and the minor arts.</p><h2>Emma (Barnes &amp; Noble Classics)</h2><p><i>Emma</i>, by <b>Jane Austen</b>, is part of the <i>Barnes &amp; Noble Classics</i><i>&nbsp;</i>series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras.

Thinking herself impervious to romance of any kind, Emma tries to arrange a wealthy marriage for poor Harriet, but refuses to recognize her own feelings for the gallant Mr. Knightley. What ensues is a delightful series of scheming escapades in which every social machination and bit of "tittle-tattle" is steeped in Austen's delicious irony. Ultimately, Emma discovers that "Perfect happiness, even in memory, is not common."<br><br>Virginia Woolf called Jane Austen "the most perfect artist among women," and Emma Woodhouse is arguably her most perfect creation. Though Austen found her heroine to be a person whom "no one but myself will much like," <i>Emma</i> is her most cleverly woven, riotously comedic, and pleasing novel of manners.<br><br></p><p><b>Steven Marcus</b> is Professor of English and Comparative Literature and George Delacorte Professor in the Humanities at Columbia University, and a specialist in nineteenth-century literature and culture.

He is the author of more than 200 publications.</p></p><p>Of all Jane Austen's heroines, Emma Woodhouse is the most flawed, the most infuriating, and, in the end, the most endearing. <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>'s Lizzie Bennet has more wit and sparkle; Catherine Morland in <i> Northanger Abbey</i> more imagination; and <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>'s Elinor Dashwood certainly more sense--but Emma is lovable precisely because she is so imperfect. Austen only completed six novels in her lifetime, of which five feature young women whose chances for making a good marriage depend greatly on financial issues, and whose prospects if they fail are rather grim. <i>Emma</i> is the exception: "Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her." One may be tempted to wonder what Austen could possibly find to say about so fortunate a character. The answer is, quite a lot. <p> For Emma, raised to think well of herself, has <i>such</i> a high opinion of her own worth that it blinds her to the opinions of others. The story revolves around a comedy of errors: Emma befriends Harriet Smith, a young woman of unknown parentage, and attempts to remake her in her own image. Ignoring the gaping difference in their respective fortunes and stations in life, Emma convinces herself and her friend that Harriet should look as high as Emma herself might for a husband--and she zeroes in on an ambitious vicar as the perfect match. At the same time, she reads too much into a flirtation with Frank Churchill, the newly arrived son of family friends, <i>and</i> thoughtlessly starts a rumor about poor but beautiful Jane Fairfax, the beloved niece of two genteelly impoverished elderly ladies in the village. As Emma's fantastically misguided schemes threaten to surge out of control, the voice of reason is provided by Mr. Knightly, the Woodhouse's longtime friend and neighbor. Though Austen herself described Emma as "a heroine whom no one but myself will much like," she endowed her creation with enough charm to see her through her most egregious behavior, and the saving grace of being able to learn from her mistakes. By the end of the novel Harriet, Frank, and Jane are all properly accounted for, Emma is wiser (though certainly not sadder), and the reader has had the satisfaction of enjoying Jane Austen at the height of her powers. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Emma is Austen&#39;s most technically accomplished novel, with a hidden plot, the full implications of which are only revealed by a second reading. The text presented here retains the spelling and punctuation of the first edition of 1816, allowing readers to see the novel as Austen&#39;s contemporaries first encountered it. The volume provides comprehensive explanatory notes, an extensive critical introduction, a chronology of Austen&#39;s life, and an authoritative textual apparatus. This edition is an indispensable resource for all scholars and readers of Austen.</p><h2>The Practice of Business Statistics: Using Data for Decisions</h2><p>This text brings the same data analysis approach to business statistics that has made lead author David Moore the best selling author in today's Stats market.&nbsp; <i>The Practice of Business Statistics</i> shows students how to analyze data and make informed decisions in today's business world.&nbsp; Real world applications from accounting, finance, marketing, manufacturing and other areas of the business world add relevancy.<br><i>&nbsp;<br><b>The Practice of Business Statistics</b></i> is available in these versions:<b>Core Text w/CD</b> <b>(Chapters 1 - 11)</b>,&nbsp;&nbsp;0-7167-9773-9<br><b></b><b>Companion Chapters 12-18 on advanced inference topics</b> (available separately, or at a discount with packaged with the core book.

It dates to a little-known period early in his career when he immersed himself in the Jewish cultural renaissance that flourished in Russia from roughly 1912 to the early 1920s. Signed with his Hebrew given name, this volume-with its wraparound cover, colorful lithographic montages, and stylized use of Yiddish and Aramaic words-celebrates Lissitzky's interest in Jewish folk traditions while looking forward to the dynamic graphic and typographic designs for which he is best remembered.<br> This near-scale facsimile-including the rarely seen cover-allows readers to experience Lissitzky's <em>Had gadya</em> as originally envisioned. It is accompanied here by Nancy Perloff's discussion of the work's cultural and artistic contexts, Arnold J. Band's English translation of Lissitzky's Yiddish version of the song, sections on Lissitzky's iconography and vocabulary, and lyrics set to music.</p><p><br><strong>Arnold J.

In the first-ever history about the organization, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Annie Jacobsen draws on inside sources, exclusive interviews, private documents, and declassified memos to paint a picture of DARPA, or "the Pentagon's brain," from its Cold War inception in 1958 to the present.<br><br>This is <i>the</i> book on DARPA--a compelling narrative about this clandestine intersection of science and the American military and the often frightening results.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of September 2015:</strong> If you&#x2019;re searching for an obtuse, synapse-dulling book on DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) and its mission to create breakthrough military technologies, look elsewhere. Jacobsen&#x2019;s nimble account of the ultra-secret R&amp;D arm of the Defense Department engagingly details the shrouded history of the organization, starting with its genesis during the nuclear arms race and covering its efforts up through today. In her final section, Jacobsen offers solid but chilling conjectures on what covert programs DARPA is focused on now. Jacobsen (a journalist and the author of <em>Operation Paperclip</em> and <em>Area 51</em>) strikes a balance between lauding the technology leaps driven by DARPA and pointing out that the ultimate goal is to create wartime tools to guarantee U.S. dominance. DARPA&#x2019;s successes include lighter machine guns (developed for slighter-bodied soldiers during the Vietnamese war and now standard U.S. issue), the Internet, GPS, and drones. Says Jacobsen, &#x201c;DARPA creates, DARPA dominates, and when sent to the battlefield, DARPA destroys.&#x201d; But, Jacobsen also asks, &#x201c;what if some of these &#x2018;dramatic new capabilities&#x2019; are not such a great idea?&#x201d; </p> <p>Hawks will find plenty of meat in here to fuel their arguments for the value of top-secret U.S. military programs. At the same time, doves will be well bolstered to pose uncomfortable questions about the worthiness of such activities in a free country.

Unlike process, social context, or symbolic function, structure is - with negligible exceptions - always determinable; it can be objectively observed; and it is varied enough for significant grouping and sub-grouping. In this monumental work, moreover, the structures, and the descriptive terms applied to them, are clearly presented according to their logical relationships to each other, generally moving from the simplest to the most complex. Illustrated with specially constructed and photographed examples made from cotton string and with extant fabrics from different cultures, the book is divided into three parts: the raw materials of fabric structures (fibres, filaments, and fabric elements); then, in the major section of the book, the fabric structures themselves, whether felted - derived directly from fibres - or made from interworked yarns; and, lastly, structures - such as stitches or applique - that are accessory to fabrics.Irene Emery (1900-1981) was Curator of Technical Studies at the Textile Museum in Washington.</p><h2>Felson&#39;s Principles of Chest Roentgenology Text with CD-ROM (Goodman, Felson&#39;s Principles of Chest Roentgenology)</h2><p>This classic text is the must-have primer of chest radiology.

She was previously public relations director of the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation. <p>Minneapolis photographer Christian Korab specializes in architecture and historic interiors. His previous books, featuring his work and that of his famous father, Balthazar Korab, include The Genius of Frank Lloyd Wright: Oak Park.</p>-It was a new look for a new century. Low, ground-hugging houses with refreshingly spacious interiors under sweeping roofs, leading to terraces reaching out to nature, all dressed in the colors of the prairie in autumn and simplified with built-in furniture. A group of idealistic young architects in Chicago, led by Frank Lloyd Wright, had succeeded in their quiet revolt against the fussiness of Victorian houses. Gazing toward the horizon, they saw the prairie as the perfect metaphor for redefining the American home. <p>-"Prairie Style" opens the doors into three dozen of the astonishingly new houses, gardens, and entire communities brought about by this revolutionary band. Here are Wright's first great Prairie houses and a handful of other Wright classics that clearly show why he is one of the most revered architects of modern times. And, finally giving due attention to Wright's Prairie School colleagues-among them Louis Sullivan, Purcell and Elmslie, Walter Burley Griffin, and Marion Mahony-author Dixie Legler takes us inside their own exemplary houses, which responded to a more relaxed style of living with the same serene simplicity that has made Wright's own work such a favorite around the world. These sheltering Prairie-style houses, beautifully captured in Christian Korab's all-new color photographs, inspired generations of homes to come and changed the shape of suburban America. </p><p>-Prairie School Designers brought nature right up to the door-and sometimes inside-as the book's select crop of gardens illustrates. The Prairie vision extended even further, to whole communities. Prairie Style visits four of these comfortable neighborhoods, including one just now rising from the prairie, where houses join with the landscape to prove the satisfactions of living in harmony with nature. Attention-getting in 1900, the Prairie style produced a time-less way of building as inviting today as it was a century ago. "Prairie houses," says Legler, "speak to something deep within all of us: rooted in the land, they fill our need to put down roots."</p></p><h2>Loving-Kindness in Plain English: The Practice of Metta</h2><p><b>The bestselling author of <i>Mindfulness in Plain English</i> invites us to explore the joyful benefits of living with loving-kindness.</b><br><br>With his signature clarity and warmth, Bhante Gunaratana shares with us how we can cultivate loving-kindness to live a life of joyful harmony with others.

Also discussed are the four characteristics of a boundary violation&#x2015;a reversal of roles, a secret, a double bind, and an indulgence of professional privilege&#x2015;and the damage to the client. Throughout the book, clients share their stories of violations&#x2015;sometimes blatant, often subtle&#x2015;in relationships. These vignettes, along with Peterson&#x2019;s engaging style, transform ethics from dry, abstract, and theoretical principles to vital struggles to understand and appropriately manage power with clients.</p><p>Professionals can no longer afford to be uninformed about their professional vulnerability. A better informed public and increasingly litigious society place them at risk for possible legal action and professional sanctions when they violate professional-client boundaries. This book addresses boundary violations through the lens of the professional-client relationship, drawing examples of misconduct from law, medicine, religion, education, and psychotherapy--professions which oblige the professional to place the client&#39;s needs first. Professional misconduct is commonly defined by content (for example, sexual harassment or misuse of client funds); this practice eclipses the injury to the relationship itself and ignores, dismisses, or normalizes violations that do not fit within the specific categories of malfeasance or codes of ethics. At Personal Risk expands the spectrum of behaviors that are hurtful to clients by redefining violations as a process of disconnection that occurs within the relational context. The first three chapters cover the social context of the relationship, the inherent power differential that delineates the relational boundaries, and professionals&#39; difficulty with managing that power appropriately. The fourth and fifth chapters describe the four characteristics of a boundary violation--a reversal of roles, a secret, a double bind, and an indulgence of professional privilege--and the damage to the client. The sixth chapter prescribes the healing process for the client and the professional, and the seventh examines the blocks to a relational solution. Throughout the book, clients share their stories of violations--sometimes blatant, often subtle--in relationshipswith doctors, therapists, clergy, teachers, and lawyers. These vignettes, along with Peterson&#39;s engaging style, change ethics from dry, abstract, and theoretical principles to vital struggles to understand and appropriately manage power with clients. At Personal Risk is preventative, in providing professionals with an early warning system to alert them to impending trouble. It is also unique in that it prescribes the healing that can help professionals recognize their impact and take steps to restore breached boundaries and repair the relationship.</p><h2>Sonography Principles and Instruments</h2><p><p>Learn how diagnostic ultrasound works, and find out how to properly handle artifacts, scan safely, evaluate instrument performance, and prepare for registry examinations, with the market-leading <b>Sonography Principles and Instruments, 9th Edition.</b> It concisely and comprehensively covers the essential aspects of ultrasound physics and instrumentation like Doppler, artifacts, safety, quality assurance, and the newest technology &#x2015; all in a dynamic, highly visual format for easy review of key information.

Churchland and Patricia S. ChurchlandThis book represents the views of one of the greatest mathematicians of the twentieth century on the analogies between computing machines and the living human brain. John von Neumann concludes that the brain operates in part digitally, in part analogically, but uses a peculiar statistical language unlike that employed in the operation of man-made computers. This edition includes a new foreword by two eminent figures in the fields of philosophy, neuroscience, and consciousness.</p><p>Whether they think that artificial intelligence is impossible or inevitable, most people have highly polarized views on it. John von Neumann, genius, mathematician, and inventor of the nearly ubiquitous computer architecture that bears his name, blazed trails for both camps in <i>The Computer and the Brain</i>. This short book, which was written originally for Yale's Silliman lectures, but published posthumously, summarizes his views on machine and biological intelligence with unprecedented clarity and precision. His understanding of neuroscience was that of a brilliant and strongly motivated amateur at the end of the 1950s--good enough to take on the problem, but by no means matching his comprehension of the machines to which he had devoted much of his professional life. Still, his take on intracranial computation is stunningly prescient--he looks beyond the then-fashionable digital metaphors to suggest a semi-analog strategy that uses parallel processing to make up for its deficiency in speed. Prominent neuroscientific thinkers Paul M. Churchland and Patricia S. Churchland provide a brief, enlightening foreword to this second edition, placing the author's thinking in context and grounding the reader in the scientific milieu that gave rise to <i>The Computer and the Brain</i>. Although his computer architecture slowly is growing obsolete, von Neumann has given us a more lasting legacy in his thinking about thinking. <i>--Rob Lightner</i>At the time of his death in February 1957, John von Neumann, renowned for his theory of games and his work at the Electronic Computer Project at the Institute for Advanced Study, was serving as a member of the Atomic Energy Commission.

It succeeds at telling the amazing story of the universe and the creation of Earth with scientific accuracy but without diminishing the mystery and wonder. The three books together tell OUR STORY. As cosmologist and author Dr. Brian Swimme said: In the magic of this story . . . suddenly, we have the feeling that we BELONG. The second book is From Lava to Life: The Universe Tells Our Earth Story. The final book is Mammals Who Morph: The Universe Tells Our Evolution Story.</p><p>Winner of the <b>2003 Learning Magazine Teacher's Choice Award</b>Jennifer Morgan&#x2019;s work as a storyteller, author, educator and environmental advocate flows out of her love of the natural world and cosmology. As former director of the Northeast Organic Farming Association of New Jersey, she started numerous educational and marketing programs for farmers and consumers, both locally and nationally. Currently she is an adjunct staff member at Genesis Farm, teaching the Sacred Universe Story. A portion of Ms. Morgan&#x2019;s royalties from the sale of this book are donated to earth literacy centers. Her storytelling evolved from bedtime stories for her son who wanted to know more and more, even the texture of the edge of the Universe. She believes that our cosmology stories fundamentally shape us&#x2014;our relationships, our work, our play, our culture, our institutions, our everything. <p>Dana Lynne Andersen, M.A., is a multi-media artist, playwright and teacher with degrees in philosophy and consciousness studies. Her paintings, often very large in size, explore the swirling forces of energy that underlie matter and seek to reveal life's numinous mystery. She believes that as our "depth perception" expands - billions of galaxies discovered in our lifetime! - it is also essential to expand perception inwardly to the vastness within. She is founder of Awakening Arts, a network of artists who "affirm the noble purpose of art as a vehicle for uplifting the human spirit."

It provoked a vast number of imitations and remained steadily in print through the eighteenth century (with sporadic reprints after that). It still possesses an enormous vigor and vitality.<br>The book owes its long life to an imagination, wit, and humor rich with insights into human nature, yet neither bitter nor namby pamby. Its commentary on the boasting, pedantry, false learning, gambling, gluttony, medical folly, adultery, greed, envy, hatred, pride and other failings that mark humanity are sharp and telling, and, sadly, as relevant today as they were 450 years ago.<br>This translation by Professor Edwin H. Zeydel is the only accurate English translation ever published. (Barclay's version is really a pastiche written in imitation of Brant.) The form Professor Zeydel uses is verse, like the original, and he even retains the original rhyme scheme and meter. The achievement is remarkable, for it captures all the charm and movement of the original German while sacrificing nothing to readability and fluidity.<br>Published now with the 114 original Renaissance woodcuts and with Professor Zeydel's annotations, a biography of Brant, a publishing history, and a survey of the work's influence, this will unquestionably remain the definitive edition of <i>The Ship of Fools</i> in English.

This book traces the artist&#x2019;s successive triumphs as a draftsman, first in the Netherlands and later in France, highlighting the diversity of his technical invention and the striking continuity of his vision. Given the pivotal role drawings played in Van Gogh&#x2019;s artistic conception and the rich dialectic they enjoyed with his oil paintings, a small selection of related canvases by the artist is also featured.<p></p>This beautiful book presents approximately 120 works in charcoal, ink, graphite, watercolor, and diluted oils. The authors explore enduring questions that surround Van Gogh&#x2019;s drawings, including their manufacture, artistic precedents, and contribution to Modernism. In addition, the text discusses the significance of the artist&#x2019;s drawing practice to his development as a painter. The essays and entries feature the most current research on Van Gogh&#x2019;s drawings and provide fresh interpretations of the motivating influences that shaped the artist&#x2019;s contributions to the history of drawing.<p></p></p><p><p>This book takes a comprehensive look at Vincent van Gogh&#x2019;s beautiful and varied drawings, showcasing about 120 of his works in charcoal, chalk, ink, graphite, and watercolor.

Skinny-dipping in the frigid waters of North Lake after the Halloween dance is a Bates Academy tradition, though not many students have the guts to honor it. Three years ago, I was the first freshman to not only jump, but stay under so long they thought I&#x2019;d drowned. I didn&#x2019;t mean to.<br><br>I jumped because I could, because I was bored, because one of the seniors had made fun of my pathetic dollar-store costume and I wanted to prove I was better than her. I kicked down to the bottom, pushing past clumps of moss and silky strands of pondweed. And I stayed there, sunk my fingers into the soft, crumbling silt until my lungs twisted and convulsed, because even though the freezing water cut like knives, it was soundless. It was peaceful. It was like being encased safely in a thick block of ice, protected from the world. I might have stayed if I could. But my body didn&#x2019;t allow it. I broke the surface and the upperclasswomen screamed my name and passed me a bottle of flat champagne, and we scattered as campus police broke up the scene. That was my official &#x201c;arrival&#x201d; at Bates. It was my first time away from home, and I was no one. I was determined to redesign myself completely into a Bates girl, and as soon as I took that dive, I knew exactly what kind of girl I would be. The kind who jumps first and stays under ten seconds too long.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>Now we&#x2019;re the seniors and no first-years have dared to tag along.<br><br>My best friend, Brie Matthews, runs ahead, her sleek track-star body cutting through the night air. Normally, we would strip under the thorny bushes that line the lake next to the Henderson dorms. It&#x2019;s our traditional meeting spot after we pregame in one of our rooms and stumble across the green together, still in costume. But Brie received an early-recruitment offer from Stanford tonight and she is on fire. She ordered us to meet her at ten to midnight, giving us just enough time between the dance and the dive to ditch valuables, load up on refreshments, and deal with significant-other drama. Then she met us at the edge of the green wearing only a bathrobe and an exhilarated grin, her cheeks flushed and breath hot and sweet with hard cider. She dropped the robe and said, &#x201c;Dare you.&#x201d;<br><br>Tai Carter runs just ahead of me, her hands pressed over her mouth to cram her laughter in. She is still wearing a pair of angel wings and they flutter with her long silvery hair twisting in the wind. The rest of our group trails behind. Tricia Parck trips over a tree root, nearly causing a pileup. Cori Gates stops running and falls to the ground, cracking up. I slow, grinning, but the air is freezing, and my skin is covered in goose bumps. I still get a thrill from the icy plunge, but my favorite part now is snuggling together with Brie under a mountain of blankets and giggling about it afterward.<br><br>I am about to make the final sprint across the patch of dead moss stretching from Henderson&#x2019;s emergency exit to the edge of the lake when I hear Brie scream. Tai halts and I push past her toward the sound of frenetic splashing. Brie&#x2019;s frantic voice escalates in pitch, repeating my name over and over, faster and faster. I tear through the bushes, thorns etching white and red stripes in my skin, grab her hands, and haul her up out of the lake.<br><br>&#x201c;Kay,&#x201d; she breathes into my neck, her dripping body shivering violently, teeth clicking and chattering. My heart batters my rib cage as I look her over for blood or cuts. Her thick black hair lies damply over her skull; her smooth brown skin, unlike mine, is unbroken.<br><br>Then Tai grabs my hand so hard, my fingertips go numb. Her face, usually caught between a genuine grin and mocking smirk, is arranged in a strange blank stare. I turn and an odd sensation creeps over me, like my skin is turning to stone one cell at a time.<br><br>There&#x2019;s a body in the lake.<br><br>&#x201c;Go get our clothes,&#x201d; I whisper.<br><br>Someone scampers away behind us, kicking up a flurry of dry leaves.<br><br>Fragments of moonlight lie like shattered glass over the surface of the water. At the edge, tangles of roots reach down into the shallows. The body floats not far from where we&#x2019;re standing, a girl with a pale, upturned face under about an inch of water. Her eyes are open, her lips white and parted, her expression almost dazed, except that it isn&#x2019;t anything. An elaborate white ball gown blooms around her like petals. Her arms are bare and there are long cuts up and down her wrists. I grab my own half-consciously, and then flinch as I feel a hand on my shoulder.<br><br>Maddy Farrell, the youngest of our group, hands me my dress. I nod stiffly and pull the loose black shift over my head. I am Daisy Buchanan from&nbsp;<i>The Great Gatsby</i>, but my dress was repurposed from the costume Brie wore last year and it&#x2019;s a size too large. Now I wish I&#x2019;d chosen to dress as an astronaut. Not only is it freezing out, but I feel stripped and vulnerable in the gauzy fabric.<br><br>&#x201c;What should we do?&#x201d; Maddy asks, looking at me. But I can&#x2019;t tear my gaze away from the lake to answer her.<br><br>&#x201c;Call Dr. Klein,&#x201d; Brie says. &#x201c;She&#x2019;ll contact the parents.&#x201d;<br><br>I force myself to look at Maddy. Her wide-set eyes are glossy with tears, and dark, uneven streaks run down her face. I smooth her soft golden hair reassuringly but keep my own expression even. My chest feels like bursting and a siren is blaring somewhere deep in my mind, but I silence it with imagery. A room of ice, soundless, safe. No crying. A teardrop can be the snowflake that starts an avalanche.<br><br>&#x201c;The school comes first. Then the cops,&#x201d; I say. No point in someone seeing on their newsfeed that their kid is dead before they get the phone call. That was how my dad learned about my brother. It was trending.<br><br>Maddy takes out her phone and dials the headmistress&#x2019;s number while the rest of us huddle in the darkness, staring at the dead girl&#x2019;s body. With her open eyes and lips parted as if mid-sentence, she looks so close to being alive. Close, but not quite. It&#x2019;s not the first dead body I&#x2019;ve ever seen, but it&#x2019;s the first one that&#x2019;s almost seemed to look right back at me.<br><br>&#x201c;Does anyone know her?&#x201d; I finally ask.<br><br>No one answers. Unbelievable. The six of us, separately, probably hold more social capital than the rest of the student body combined. We must know nearly every single student between us.<br><br>But only students are allowed at the Skeleton Dance. At other dances, we are permitted to bring guys and other off-campus dates. The girl in the lake is our age and elaborately dressed and made-up. She has a familiar face, but not one I can place. Especially not like this. I lean over, clutching my arms to try to keep from shivering too hard, to get another look at her wrists. It&#x2019;s a grisly sight, but I find what I&#x2019;m looking for: a thin, glowing neon tube.<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s wearing the wristband. She was at the dance. She&#x2019;s one of us.&#x201d; I shudder at the words as they leave my lips.<br><br>Tricia studies the ripples in the lake without raising her eyes quite high enough to look at the body again. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve seen her around. She&#x2019;s a student.&#x201d; She twists her silky black hair absently and then lets it fall over her perfect replica of Emma Watson&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Beauty and the Beast</i>&nbsp;ball gown.<br><br>&#x201c;Not anymore,&#x201d; Tai says.<br><br>&#x201c;Not funny.&#x201d; Brie glares at her, but someone had to break the tension sooner or later. It knocks me back into myself again a little. I close my eyes and picture the ice walls doubling, tripling in thickness, until there&#x2019;s no room for sirens in my mind, no room for my heart to thump chaotically off rhythm.<br><br>Then I stand up straighter and eye Maddy&#x2019;s costume, Little Red Riding Hood with a scandalously short dress and a warm-looking cape.<br><br>&#x201c;Can I borrow your cape?&#x201d; I hold out one finger, and she slips the warm shrug off her pale, bony shoulders and hands it to me. I only feel a little bad. It&#x2019;s cold and I&#x2019;m a year older. She&#x2019;ll get her turn.<br><br>A wailing sound fills the air and a swirl of red-and-blue lights hurtle toward us from across the campus.<br><br>&#x201c;That was fast,&#x201d; I murmur.<br><br>&#x201c;I guess Klein decided to notify the cops herself,&#x201d; Brie says.<br><br>Cori emerges from the darkness clutching a bottle of champagne, her catlike green eyes seeming to glow in the dim light. &#x201c;I could have called Klein. But nobody asked.&#x201d; Cori never misses an opportunity to mention her family&#x2019;s connection to the headmistress.<br><br>Maddy hugs herself. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. I didn&#x2019;t think.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Typical Notorious,&#x201d; Tai says, shaking her head. Maddy glares at her.<br><br>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t matter. She&#x2019;ll be here soon.&#x201d; Brie wraps an arm around Maddy. The bathrobe looks thick and soft, and Maddy nuzzles her cheek to it. I narrow my eyes and toss the cape back to her, but overshoot, and it lands in the lake.<br><br>Tai stabs the waterlogged mass with a stick and fishes it out, dumping it at my feet. &#x201c;I remember her. Julia. Jennifer. Gina?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jemima? Jupiter?&#x201d; I snap at her, wringing the cape out as well as I can.<br><br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know her name, and no one recognized her at all at first,&#x201d; Brie says. &#x201c;It would be misleading to tell the police we knew her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t look at her face. Sorry. I can&#x2019;t. So . . .&#x201d; Maddy pulls her arms inside her dress, making her look like a creepy armless doll with her chalk-white skin and smudged dark eye makeup. &#x201c;We should lie?&#x201d;<br><br>Brie looks to me for help.<br><br>&#x201c;I think Brie means we should simplify by saying we didn&#x2019;t recognize her and leave it at that.&#x201d;<br><br>Brie squeezes my hand.<br><br>Campus police arrive first, braking in front of Henderson and thundering out of the car toward us. I&#x2019;ve never seen them move like that and it&#x2019;s scary in a sort of pathetic way. It&#x2019;s not like they&#x2019;re real cops. Their sole job is to drive us around and break up parties.<br><br>&#x201c;Stand aside, ladies.&#x201d; Jenny Biggs, a young officer who often escorts us across campus after hours and turns a blind eye to our private soirees, ushers us out of the way. Her partner, a hulk of a male officer, barrels past us and wades into the water. A bitter taste forms under my tongue, and I dig my fingernails into my palms. There&#x2019;s no real reason for it, but I feel protective of the body. I don&#x2019;t want his hairy-ass hands touching her.<br><br>&#x201c;I think you&#x2019;re not supposed to disturb a crime scene,&#x201d; I whisper to Jenny, hoping she&#x2019;ll intervene. She&#x2019;s been really nice to us over the years, joking and bending rules almost like an older sister.<br><br>She looks at me sharply, but before she can say anything, the real cops arrive along with an ambulance. The EMTs make it to the lake before the cops, and one of them dives into the water after Jenny&#x2019;s partner.<br><br>&#x201c;Do not approach the victim,&#x201d; barks one of the officers, a tall woman with a strong Boston accent, jogging toward the lake&#x2019;s edge.<br><br>The campus police officer, now waist deep in the water, turns and crashes into the EMT.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s like the incompetence Olympics,&#x201d; Tai murmurs. <br><br>Another officer, a short Tony Soprano look-alike, nods dismissively to Jenny like she&#x2019;s a servant. &#x201c;Get this guy out of here,&#x201d; he says.<br><br>Jenny looks a little miffed, but she waves to her partner, who reluctantly takes the EMT by the arm. They escort him up the bank, shooting daggers at the townie cops.<br><br>The woman officer, the one who called off the rescue mission, looks at us suddenly. She has a sharp chin, beady eyes, and over-plucked eyebrows that make her look sort of like a half-drawn Intro-to-Art exercise. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the girls who found the body.&#x201d;<br><br>She doesn&#x2019;t wait for a response. She leads us over to the water&#x2019;s edge as more officers arrive to rope off the area. Brie and I exchange questioning glances and I try to catch Jenny&#x2019;s eye, but she&#x2019;s busy securing the scene. Students are beginning to filter out of the dorms. Even housemothers&#x2014; the adults in charge of each dorm&#x2014;have drifted out and to the edges of the newly erected safety barriers and lines of police tape. The tall cop flashes a tight-lipped smile. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Detective Bernadette Morgan. Which one of you girls made that phone call?&#x201d;<br><br>Maddy raises her hand.<br><br>Detective Morgan whips a cell phone out of her pocket and shows the video screen to us. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a terrible memory, girls, do you mind if I record this?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; Maddy says, then darts her eyes to me with an apologetic expression. Detective Morgan seems to note this with interest and flashes me a crooked smile before turning back to Maddy.<br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need your friend&#x2019;s permission.&#x201d;<br><br>Tai glances down at the cell phone. &#x201c;Oh my God, is that an iPhone 4? I didn&#x2019;t know they still made those. Or that it was legal to record minors making statements on them.&#x201d;<br><br>The detective&#x2019;s smile brightens. &#x201c;Witness statements. Do I have your permission, or shall we go to the station and call your parents in?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Go for it,&#x201d; Tai says, hugging herself and shivering.<br><br>The others nod, but I hesitate for just a nanosecond. Jenny is one thing, but I don&#x2019;t have much faith in cops otherwise. I spent half of eighth grade talking to various police officers and it was a hellish experience. On the other hand, I would go to extraordinary lengths to avoid involving my parents.<br><br>&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; I say.<br><br>Detective Morgan laughs. The sound is nasal and abrasive. &#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d;<br><br>The cold is beginning to wear on me and I can&#x2019;t help impatience and annoyance from saturating my voice. &#x201c;Yeah.

C. McKeown (Everyman&#39;s Library Classics Series)</h2><p>Ovid&#x2019;s famous mock epic&#x2014;a treasury of myth and magic that is one of the greatest literary works of classical antiquity&#x2014;is rendered into fluidly poetic English by world-renowned translator Allen Mandelbaum.<br><br> Roman poet Ovid&#x2019;s dazzling cycle of tales begins with the creation of the world and ends with the deification of Caesar Augustus. In between is a glorious panoply of the most famous myths and legends of the ancient Greek and Roman world&#x2014;from Echo&#x2019;s passion for Narcissus to Pygmalion&#x2019;s living statue, from Perseus&#x2019;s defeat of Medusa to the fall of Troy. Retold with Ovid&#x2019;s irreverent flair, these tales are united by the theme of metamorphosis, as men and women are rendered alien to themselves, turned variously to flowers, trees, animals, and stones. The closest thing to a central character is love itself&#x2014;a confounding, transforming, irrational force that makes fools of gods and mortals alike. <br><br> The poem&#x2019;s playful verses, both sensually earthy and wittily sophisticated, have reverberated through the centuries, inspiring countless artists and writers from Shakespeare to the present. Frequently translated, imitated, and adapted, <i>The Metamorphoses</i> has lost none of its power to provoke and entertain.</p><p>The Roman poet PUBLIUS OVIDIUS NASO, known to the English-speaking world as Ovid, was born in 43 BC and died in 17 AD. His major works, Ars amatoria and Metamophorses, were famed both for their technical mastery and their innovative interpretations of classical myth. His verses were immensely influential on European art and literature, and remain important source texts of Greek and Roman mythology.<br><br>ABOUT THE TRANSLATOR: Allen Mandelbaum was born in 1926 and died in 2011. His translations of Homer, Dante, Virgil, Quasimodo, and Ungaretti were all published to great acclaim. His rendering of The Aeneid won the National Book Award. He was the William R. Kenan, Jr. Professor of Humanities at Wake Forest University, North Carolina. <br><br>ABOUT THE INTRODUCER:&nbsp; J. C. McKeown has served as a Research Fellow and Senior Tutor at the University of Cambridge and is now Professor of Classics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. His publications include a commentary on Ovid's <i>Amores</i> and<i> A Cabinet of Roman Curiosities</i>. He is currently working on <i>The Oxford Anthology of Literature in the Roman World</i>, which will be published in summer 2013.<i>Excerpted from the Introduction</i><br>THE POETRY OF THE AUGUSTAN AGE<br><br>Many periods in Rome&#x2019;s long history produced great poets.From the end of the Republic in the mid-first century BC , we have Lucretius&#x2019;s Epicurean masterpiece, On the Nature of Things, and the kaleidoscopic variety of Catullus&#x2019;s oeuvre, ranging from the coarse obscenities of political epigram, through beautiful love lyrics, to the sophistication of epicizing mythological narrative. Nero (ruled AD 54 &#x2013;68 ) had a high opinion of his own poetic talents, but they were quite eclipsed by the tragedies of his adviser, Seneca the Younger, and by the Civil War , the political epic of Seneca&#x2019;s nephew, Lucan. The years before and after the richly deserved assassination of Domitian in AD 96&nbsp; produced the stiletto wit of Martial&#x2019;s epigrams and the powerful satires of Juvenal, as marvellously trenchant and memorable as they are intolerant and appalling. It is universally agreed, however, that the poetic achievements of no other period can stand comparison with those of the age of Augustus, the first emperor, who attained sole rule with his victory over Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC , and maintained it ever more firmly throughout his long reign &#x2013; longer than that of any later emperor &#x2013; eventually to die peacefully in his bed, a privilege enjoyed by very few of his rivals and enemies, <br><br>in AD 14 , at the age of seventy-five. In the 20 s BC , the literary salons controlled by Augustus&#x2019;s chief political adviser, Maecenas, and by his military commander, Messalla Corvinus, provided a galaxy of great poets with a venue for the recitation of their latest works. Virgil had already established his reputation with his Eclogues , pastoral poetry in imitation of the third-century BC&nbsp; Sicilian Greek poet Theocritus, and with his Georgics , a didactic poem on farming in four books, modelled on theWorks and Days , composed in the eighth century BC&nbsp; by Hesiod, Greece&#x2019;s earliest literate poet. He was now at work on his last and greatest poem, the Aeneid , an epic to rival both the Iliad&nbsp; and the Odyssey . Horace had published his Satires&nbsp; and Epodes&nbsp; in the 30 s, and was to publish the&nbsp; first three of his four books of Odes&nbsp; in 23 BC . Love elegy also flourished in this decade. The genre appears to have been invented by Cornelius Gallus, a friend of Virgil and one of Octavian/Augustus&#x2019;s most trusted lieutenants. In the late 40 s and early 30 s, Gallus had written four books of elegies, now almost entirely lost. He is the only one of the great Augustan poets to suff er this misfortune, which must be connected to some extent with his fall from favour with Augustus as a resultof his arrogance as the first Roman governor of Egypt, behaviour which compelled him to commit suicide in 27&nbsp; or 26 . Gallus&#x2019;s genre, however, lived on and prospered, first with Tibullus and Propertius, both of whom will have started to compose at about the beginning of the decade, and then with Ovid, for it was with love elegy that he began his poetic career, perhaps in 26&nbsp; or 25 BC , when he was seventeen or eighteen years old.<br>OVID&#x2019;S OTHER POETRY<br><br>The Amores&nbsp; &#x2013;Ovid&#x2019;s earliest love poetry &#x2013; follow the conventions laid down by his predecessors and older contemporaries, in that they are collections of poems recounting the vicissitudes of his relationship with his mistress. The elegies of both Tibullus and Propertius display a wide range of emotional levels, from the wittily whimsical to the passionately tragic, suggestive of the suff erings of the lover. Ovid, by contrast, achieves originality by narrowing the focus of his elegies very drastically, presenting<br>the misfortunes he endures in his persona&nbsp; as the elegiac lover in a consistently humorous manner that sometimes falls very little short of parody of the genre.<br><br>To give just one example of this approach:&nbsp; whereas Propertius tries to convince Cynthia that she has no need of expensive jewellery to enhance her natural charms, Ovid pushes this theme of beauty unadorned to ridiculous but logical limits: when Corinna quite unnecessarily dyes her gorgeous hair, the procedure goes wrong and now she is completely bald. Such exploitation of already established conventions was to be a hallmark of all of Ovid&#x2019;s later poetry, and of the Metamorphoses&nbsp; in particular. One short elegy in the Amores&nbsp; might indeed be viewed as a prototype for the Metamorphoses . In 2 .15 , Ovid&nbsp; daydreams about how he would like to be transformed into the ring that he is sending as a gift to his mistress, for then he could always be with her. The fantasy ends abruptly when he says, with typical euphemism, that &#x2018;if she wears me in the bath, my limbs will rise with lust&#x2019;:&nbsp; Ovid the ring will react to the situation as if it were still Ovid the man. The Narcissus episode in Metamorphoses&nbsp; III is a nice illustration of the way in which he was to exploit these two typically Ovidian techniques, the deployment of conventional themes in unconventional contexts and the unusual perspective achieved, most often to witty effect, by splitting the personality and characteristics of the individual whose story is being narrated. Narcissus has fallen in love with his own reflection in a pool of water, and will remain at the water&#x2019;s edge till he is transformed into the flower that bears his name. Ovid has adapted to the myth that most typical scenario in love elegy:&nbsp; the lover&#x2019;s pleading for the door of his beloved&#x2019;s house to be opened so that he may be with her. Narcissus is cast in the role not only of the lover, but also of the beloved, and the surface of the water represents the closed door. The same scenario recurs in the Metamorphoses&nbsp; in the tales of Pyramus and Thisbe, separated by the wall made famous by Shakespeare, and of Polyphemus and Galatea, separated by the sea. Love and the conventions of love elegy are never far away in the Metamorphoses . <br><br>There is little firm evidence about the chronology of Ovid&#x2019;s poetry, but we should perhaps assume that he continued writing Amores&nbsp; poems for a decade or more, and that he was also engaged throughout much of this same period on his Heroides , letters from various mythological heroines to their absent husbands or lovers (e.g. Penelope to Ulysses, Dido to Aeneas), followed by a series of such pairs written between lovers (e.g. Paris and Helen). The Heroides&nbsp; transformed and extended the elegiac genre by casting mythological figures in the roles more familiarly played by the elegiac poets and their mistresses;&nbsp; for example, the exchange of letters between Helen and Paris focuses on the banquet given in Sparta in honour of Paris by Helen&#x2019;s husband, Menelaus, reworking the scenario played out between the lover, his mistress, and her dull-witted husband in Amores 1 .4&nbsp; and 2 .5 . The Amores&nbsp; generally make very little use&nbsp; of mythology, and it is the Heroides&nbsp; that foreshadow the wealth of such tales in the Metamorphoses . <br><br>Ovid devised a further development of the conventions of love elegy when he wrote his Art of Love , a didactic poem providing instructions on how to ensure success in love affairs;&nbsp; for example, the instructions which he gives to his mistress in Amores 1 .4&nbsp; and 2 .5&nbsp; on how to conduct herself at a banquet are turned into a general set of rules to be followed in such a context. The Art of Love&nbsp; would seem to have been planned initially as a two-book work, offering advice to men, but its success induced Ovid to add a third book, offering corresponding advice to women. He even managed yet another variation on the conventional themes of love elegy, when, as a corollary to the Art of Love , he wrote his Remedies for Love;&nbsp; whereas the Art&nbsp; gives advice on winning and keeping a lover, Remedies&nbsp; explains how to cure oneself of love, and the two poems thus form a didactic pair in much the same way as do the Poisonous Creatures&nbsp; and the Cures for Poisons&nbsp; by the Hellenistic Greek poet Nicander. Ovid was reluctant to give up his preoccupation with love elegy, which he evidently found so congenial. As late as 1 BC &#x2013; AD 1 , at the fairly advanced age of forty-two or forty-three, he was still engaged with the genre, for that is when he published the third book of the Art of Love&nbsp; and a second edition of the Amores , reduced from five books to three. <br><br>Even if he had restricted himself to love elegy, his reputation would have been assured, but he had higher literary aspirations. At some unknown date, perhaps around 15 BC , he wrote a tragedy, the Medea , of which only two short fragments, a total of twelve words, have survived. Apart from a translation of the Phaenomena , a poem on astronomy and weather signs by the Hellenistic court poet Aratus, it is his only substantial work known to be lost to us. This loss is a serious one, for all that the assessment &#x2018;Ovid&#x2019;s Medea&nbsp; shows what he might have achieved if he had been willing to control his genius rather than indulge it&#x2019; comes from Quintilian, the great teacher of oratory, who is not remarkable for his literary critical acumen. It is perhaps surprising that Ovid, the master of subversive wit, should have been successful as a tragedian, and perhaps equally surprising that, as far as we know, the Medea&nbsp; was his&nbsp; only attempt at the genre. Why should he have abandoned tragedy after one initial success? Maybe it was simply ousted from his agenda by other, more attractive, projects. Whatever the reason, by AD 8 , Ovid had been working for an indeterminable number of years on two large-scale works, the Fasti&nbsp; and the Metamorphoses . The Fasti&nbsp; is a calendar of Roman festivals and history, written in elegiac couplets, on the model of Callimachus&#x2019;s Aetia&nbsp; (Causes), an account of the customs and rituals of various Greek states, which now survives mostly in distressingly brief fragments. Substantial as are the merits of the Fasti , no one would regard it quite so highly as the Metamorphoses , and it is our great good fortune that Ovid gave more attention to composing the latter poem, for by AD 8 , its fifteen books were almost complete, whereas only the first six books of the Fasti , treating the months of January to June, had been composed.<br><br>In that fatal year, Ovid&#x2019;s life was changed utterly and forever. Augustus relegated him to the Greek trading post of Tomi on the coast of the Black Sea, modern day Costanza in Romania, at the edge of the empire, as far removed as possible from the sophisticated and cultured life of Rome, the milieu in which Ovid had thrived. For all that the reasons for his exile have been discussed voluminously by scholars, we shall probably never know why Augustus imposed this exquisitely sadistic punishment. Ovid felt unable to tell us anything, beyond saying that &#x2018;two things destroyed me, a poem and a mistake&#x2019;. The poem was the Art of Love , which ran counter to the spirit of Augustus&#x2019;s moral reforms, and it is reasonable to assume that the mistake was political in nature. We know from the poetry he wrote from exile that he had friends who were very highly placed. It may be that Ovid did not merely enjoy the literary patronage of such people, but rather that he himself belonged to the elite of Roman society. At any rate, his stepdaughter was to marry a Senator:&nbsp; her husband, Cornelius Fidus, once burst into tears in the Senate when Domitius Corbulo, Nero&#x2019;s great general, called him a &#x2018;plucked ostrich&#x2019; [struthocamelus depilatus ] (Seneca, On the Constancy of the Wise Man , 17 .1 ). Ovid languished at Tomi for at least a decade, and died there, a broken man whose every effort to obtain a recall was in vain.&nbsp; To gain sympathy and a pardon, the Tristia&nbsp; (Sad Things) and the Letters from the Black Sea&nbsp; exaggerate the harshness of his new life:&nbsp; it was not always winter, Tomi was not entirely barbaric, the natives were not forever shooting poisoned arrows over the walls. Though it is not entirely lacking in the familiar Ovidian wit, nevertheless his exile poetry makes for very sombre and depressing reading, for we are constantly aware of the disaster that had so suddenly befallen its author;&nbsp; this was not the sort of poetry he should have felt forced to write. For a decade and a half, he had been unchallenged as Rome&#x2019;s leading poet:&nbsp; Virgil had died in 19 BC , Tibullus perhaps in the same year, there are no references in Propertius&#x2019;s poetry to any event later than 16 , and with the death of Horace in 8 BC&nbsp; Ovid was left as the sole survivor of the great Augustan poets. There is some evidence that he revised the Metamorphoses&nbsp; and Fasti&nbsp; at Tomi, but his heart was not in it. Being the compulsive poet that he was, he continued to write, but we are left to wonder what great works he might have composed had he been allowed to remain in Rome.</p><h2>A Historical Dictionary of Indian Food</h2><p>With its enormous variety of cuisines, food materials, and dishes, Indian food has become popular all over the world.

SIEGEL was born in the Bronx, New York. While living on Jerome Avenue and attending City College (CCNY) in the 1960s, he was swept up in the social and political currents of the time. He became intrigued with the influence contemporary culture had on individual behavior: did people shape society or did society shape people? He applied his interest in social forces and human behavior to the study of crime and justice. After graduating from CCNY, he attended the newly opened program in criminal justice at the State University of New York at Albany, where he earned both his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees. After completing his graduate work, Dr. Siegel began his teaching career at Northeastern University, where he was a faculty member for nine years.

Her original dream was to become an architect. Instead of building houses, she now builds, with care and attention to detail, incredible texts based on this philosophy: &#34;I invite students into a chapter through an intriguing story. Once inside, they get the great windows that biologists construct on the world of life. Biology is not just another house. It is a conceptual mansion. I hope to do it justice.&#34;&#34;I use this text for non-science majors so I greatly appreciate the easy to read format, the occasional bits of humor, and many other aspects, such as the &#34;People Matter&#34; sections and the applications, which I use quite frequently for my online class. This makes the book much more readable, interesting and applicable to real life to students who are either not interested or afraid of taking a science class.&#34;</p><h2>The New Fuck You (Native Agents)</h2><p><p><b>A unique and provocative anthology of lesbian writing, guaranteed to soothe the soulful and savage the soulless.

The only clues are a wedding ring, a gold watch, a pocket edition of Boccaccio's Decameron, and a word scrawled in blood on the wall. With this investigation begins the partnership of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. Their search for the murderer uncovers a story of love and revenge-and heralds a franchise of detective mysteries starring the formidable Holmes.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700&nbsp;titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the&nbsp;series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date&nbsp;translations by award-winning translators.</p><p>Arthur Conan Doyle's <i>Study in Scarlet</i> is the first published story involving the legendary Sherlock Holmes, arguably the world's best-known detective, and the first narrative by Holmes's Boswell, the unassuming Dr. Watson, a military surgeon lately returned from the Afghan War. Watson needs a flat-mate and a diversion. Holmes needs a foil. And thus a great literary collaboration begins.<p> Watson and Holmes move to a now-famous address, 221B Baker Street, where Watson is introduced to Holmes's eccentricities as well as his uncanny ability to deduce information about his fellow beings. Somewhat shaken by Holmes's egotism, Watson is nonetheless dazzled by his seemingly magical ability to provide detailed information about a man glimpsed once under the streetlamp across the road. </p><p> Then murder. Facing a deserted house, a twisted corpse with no wounds, a mysterious phrase drawn in blood on the wall, and the buffoons of Scotland Yard--Lestrade and Gregson--Holmes measures, observes, picks up a pinch of this and a pinch of that, and generally baffles his faithful Watson. Later, Holmes explains: "In solving a problem of this sort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backward.... There are few people who, if you told them a result, would be able to evolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led up to that result." Holmes is in that elite group. </p><p> Conan Doyle quickly learned that it was Holmes's deductions that were of most interest to his readers. The lengthy flashback, while a convention of popular fiction, simply distracted from readers' real focus. It is when Holmes and Watson gather before the coal fire and Holmes sums up the deductions that led him to the successful apprehension of the criminal that we are most captivated. Subsequent Holmes stories--<i>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</i>, <i>The Return of Sherlock Holmes</i>, and <i>The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes</i>--rightly plunge the twosome directly into the middle of a baffling crime, piling mystery upon mystery until Holmes's denouement once more leaves the dazzled Watson murmuring, "You are wonderful, Holmes!"

Using his unique system, women will know exactly which colors reveal their authentic selves to the world. They'll also learn which color to wear for any occasion and how to set the tone for any event: <br><br> �Essence Color: to put others at ease �Tranquil Color: to be at ease �Vital Color: to inspire romance or show passion �Energy Color: to boost your sense of well-being �Dramatic Color: to get a little extra attention when you need to stand out<br><br> Using Zyla's groundbreaking system, women will learn to create their own pop-from-the-pack color brand.

This is accomplished by way of real-life dialogues with his clients, examples of applications, charts to keep color scores, and tips and hints throughout. Written in a colloquial style, Zyla even accompanies you on a closet purging and a shopping expedition, pointing out the way one&#x2019;s emotions block rational decision making with excuses such as &#x201c;It costs too much money to discard&#x201d; or &#x201c;My husband/wife bought it for me.&#x201d; Like having a personal fashion advisor on hand, The Color of Style lacks only one thing: illustrations to make the invisible visible. --Barbara Jacobs</p><h2>The Flight Of The Romanovs: A Family Saga</h2><p>A saga of love and lust, personal tensions and rivalries, antagonisms and hatreds, <i>The Flight of the Romanovs </i> describes the last century of the Russian imperial dynasty, the Romanovs, from the youth of the future tsar Alexander III in the 1860s until the death in 1960 of his daughter, Olga Alexandrovna, the last grand duchess.John Curtis Perry and Constantine V.

But Donald sees in consciousness the very key to understanding how humankind developed. After assaulting (with great panache) the arguments commonly deployed to remove it from the research agenda, Donald presents a natural history for consciousness, focusing particularly on its astonishing and clearly unique complexity among human beings-- Why does the human brain so closely resemble those of other primates yet so dramatically outstrip them in capacity? How does the mind endow the ego center with autonomy and a narrative autobiography? In his sophisticated conception of a multilayered consciousness drawing much of its power from its cultural matrix, Donald bids fair to reset the terms for evolutionary psychology. <i>Bryce Christensen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Ethan wonders: which life should be reported in the King David Report?<br><br> Written by one of Germany's most acclaimed dissident authors, <i>The King David Report</i> is both an analysis of the writer's obligations to truth, and an astute satire on the workings of history and politics in a totalitarian state.</p><p>Stefan Heym is representative of many intellectuals in the former East Germany who found themselves torn between loyalty to the ideals of their state and disdain for the reality. He was born into a secular Jewish family in Chemnitz. As a young man, he went to the United States to escape Hitler, where he worked for a while as a journalist. In 1943 he joined the American army. His first novel, <i>The Crusaders</i> (1948), became a best-seller. It was loosely based on his wartime experiences and filled with contempt not only for the Nazi government, but for virtually all of German culture. Distressed by the rise of McCarthyism in the United States and by Western tolerance of former Nazi officials, Heym emigrated to East Germany in 1953 and gave his enthusiastic support to the Socialist aspirations of his new homeland. His disillusionment with East Germany was far more gradual and, by his own account, more difficult than that experienced in the United States. In 1976 Heym protested the forced emigration of singer-songwriter Wolf Biermann from the German Democratic Republic. Two years later he was fined and expelled from the East German Writers' Union for accepting royalties for work published abroad. Though Heym continued to believe that the GDR was the "better-half" of Germany, disillusion with the reality of socialism moved him to turn to his Jewish heritage for inspiration in novels such as <i>The King David Report</i> (1972) and<i> The Wandering Jew</i> (1984). In 1992 he became a founding member of the "Committee for Justice," a lobby representing the interests of former East Germans in a newly united Germany."Fantastic, witty, and impudent." &#x2014;Heinrich B�ll</p><h2>The Canterbury Tales: A Prose Version in Modern English (Vintage Classics)</h2><p>A clear modern prose translation of Chaucer&#x2019;s masterpiece of Middle English storytelling by the acclaimed poet David Wright.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>The Canterbury Tales </i>has entertained readers for centuries, with its comic animal fables, moral allegories, miniature epics of courtly love, and rollicking erotic&nbsp;farces&nbsp;that bring fourteenth-century England to life on every page. The gloriously varied stories, narrated by a group of pilgrims on their way to Canterbury, are peopled with saints, sinners, and ordinary mortals in a vivid panorama of the medieval world. This prose translation renders these tales as accessible and irresistible to modern readers as they were to Chaucer&#x2019;s contemporaries.</p><p>GEOFFREY CHAUCER (1343&#x2013;1400) was England&#x2019;s most famous medieval poet and writer, sometimes called the father of English literature.<br>&nbsp;<br>DAVID WRIGHT (1920&#x2013;1994) was born in South Africa and died in England. He was a poet who drew inspiration from <i>Beowulf</i> and <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>, both of which he translated into modern English.The Knight&#x2019;s Tale<br><br>The old legends tell us there was once a Duke called Theseus who was lord and ruler of Athens. In his time there was no mightier conqueror under the sun. He had overrun many rich kingdoms, and by his generalship and knightly valour had conquered the land of the Amazons, then called Scythia, and wedded Hippolyta their queen, whom he brought home with him to his own land in the greatest pomp and splendour, together with her younger sister Emily. And so I leave this noble Duke and his armed host riding victoriously and with music towards Athens. If it weren't too long to listen to I would certainly describe in detail how the land of women was vanquished by Theseus and his knights; and especially the pitched battle between the Athenians and the Amazons; how Hippolyta, the fierce and beautiful queen of Scythia, was besieged; the feast that took place at their wedding, and the great storm that blew up on their voyage home. But for the time being I must pass over all these things&#x2014;God knows I have a big field to plough and weak oxen in my team. The rest of my tale is long enough; and I don't want to stand in the way of the others in our party. Let everyone tell his tale in turn and we'll see who wins the dinner. So I'll begin again where I left off.<br><br>The Duke I spoke of had just approached the outskirts of the town when, in the midst of all his joy and triumph, he noticed out of the corner of his eye a band of ladies dressed in black kneeling two by two in a row on the highway. They were weeping and wailing, making a lamentation the like of which no living creature ever heard; nor would they stop their clamour until they had laid hold of his bridle-rein.<br><br>'Who may you be who disturb my homecoming and the general joy with these outcries?' asked Theseus. 'Is it because you grudge me these honours that you complain and cry out like this? Or has somebody insulted or injured you? Tell me if it can be redressed, and why you are thus clothed in black.'<br><br>Almost fainting, with a deathlike countenance pitiful to see, the eldest of these ladies began to speak: 'My lord, to whom Fortune has granted victory and all the honours of a conqueror, we do not grudge you your laurels or your triumph, but beg for aid and mercy. Have mercy on our distress and grief! Out of the nobility of your heart let some drop of pity fall upon us wretched women&#x2014; for indeed, my lord, there is not one of us who was not once a duchess or a queen. But now, as anyone can see, we are the most miserable women, thanks to Fortune's treacherous wheel which sees to it that no state of affairs continues happy. Indeed, my lord, we have been waiting your arrival here in the temple of the Goddess of Pity for a whole fortnight. Now help us, Sir, since it lies in your power!<br><br>'I who weep here in misery was once the wife of King Capaneus who perished at Thebes. Cursed be that day! And all of us who are lamenting in this dress lost their husbands while the town was being besieged. Alas! alas! at this very moment old Creon, who is now lord of the city of Thebes, is filled with wrath and iniquity and dishonours their corpses: in his tyrannic spite he has dragged the bodies of our slain husbands upon a heap and will not hear of their being burned or given burial, but contemptuously gives them to the dogs to eat.'<br><br>Saying this they immediately fell upon their faces, pitifully crying out, 'Have mercy upon us wretched women, and let our grief sink into your heart.'<br><br>When the Duke heard them speak he leapt from his horse with his heart full of pity; seeing how forlorn and dejected they were who had once been of such high estate, he felt as if his heart must break. He raised each of them in his arms and tried to give comfort, swearing upon his knighthood that he would exert his utmost might to avenge them upon the tyrant till all Greece should resound with the manner in which Theseus awarded Creon the death he so richly deserved. Then without waiting further he displayed his banner to summon his men and rode against Thebes with his whole army. Nor would he approach any nearer Athens, even to rest half a day, but lodged that night on the road to Thebes. He sent his queen Hippolyta and her young and lovely sister Emily into the city of Athens there to remain while he rode forth. What more can I say?<br><br>The red image of Mars with spear and shield gleamed from his great white banner till its reflection glittered up and down all the fields through which they rode. Beside the banner was borne his pennon of rich gold embroidered with the figure of the Minotaur he had slain in Crete. So the conquering Duke rode with his army, the flower of chivalry, until he came to Thebes where he drew up in splendid array before the field of battle. But to cut the story short, he fought with Creon king of Thebes and slew him in fair combat like a valiant knight; then having routed his men he took the city by storm, tearing down walls, beams, and rafters. Next Theseus restored to the women the bones of their slain husbands so that they might be accorded the customary funeral rites. It would take much too long to describe the din of lamentation the ladies made at the burning of the corpses, or the great courtesy the noble conqueror Theseus paid them when they took leave of him, for I mean to tell my story as briefly as I can. <br><br>Having slain Creon, taken Thebes and disposed of the whole kingdom as he thought fit, the noble Duke Theseus camped quietly in the field that night. But after the battle and the flight of the Thebans, pillagers busily ransacked the pile of dead bodies, stripping them of arms and clothing. It so happened that among the heaped corpses they found two young knights lying bleeding side by side, clad in the same richly-wrought armour and pierced through with many grievous wounds. Arcite was the name of one; the other night was called Palamon. Half-dead and half-alive though they were, the heralds identified them, particularly from their coats-of-arms and equipment, as cousins and members of the royal house of Thebes. The looters dragged them from the pile of corpses and carried them gently to the tent of Theseus, who, refusing to hear of any ransom, immediately sent them to perpetual imprisonment in Athens. This done, the noble Duke and his army rode straight home, crowned with conquering laurels. And there, needless to say, he lives in honour and in joy for the remainder of his days, while Palamon and his friend Arcite are shut up forever in a tower, in misery and grief; no amount of gold can secure their release.<br><br>Thus passed the days and years, till one May morning it chanced that Emily&#x2014;she was lovelier to look upon than a lily on its stalk of green, and fresher than May with all its budding flowers; for her hue compete with the rose, and I don't know which was the prettier&#x2014;had risen and dressed herself before daylight as she often did.<br><br>The nights of May are not for sleep, for the time of the year stirs each noble heart, rousing it from slumber with the bidding, 'Arise and pay homage to the season.' This made Emily remember to do honour to the month of Ma, and she got up. Picture her clothed in bright colours, her yellow hair falling down her back and braided in a&nbsp; tress perhaps a yard long, wandering at will in the garden at the rising of the sun to gather white and scarlet flowers to weave a delicate garland for her head; and singing with a heavenly voice like an angel's.<br><br>A mighty tower, thick and strong, the principal keep of the castle in which the two knights who are the subject of my tale were shut up, adjoined the castle wall where Emily was amusing herself. The sun was bright and clear that morning; and poor captive Palamon had risen as usual. By leave of his jailer he was roaming about in an upper room from which he could see the noble prospect of the city and also the green-branched garden where Emily, so radiant and fresh, was walking up and down. As the captive Palamon sadly paced to and fro in the chamber, commiserating with himself and often crying out: 'Alas that I was born!' it happened that, whether by chance or fate, his glance fell on Emily through a window thickly fenced with iron bars as square and massive as stakes of timber: at which he started back with a cry, sung to the heart. And at the noise Arcite leapt to his feet and said, 'What is the matter, cousin? Why do you look so deadly pale? Why did you cry out? Who has upset you? For the love of God be patient with our imprisonment&#x2014;there is no alternative. This hardship is the gift of Fortune; some malign aspect or disposition of Saturn and the constellations has allotted it to us in spite of all we can do. It was in our stars when we were born; the long and short of it is, we must endure our fate.'<br><br>Palamon replied, 'Indeed, cousin, you've got hold of the wrong idea. It was not this prison which made me cry out, for just now my eye was pierced right through to my heart with a wound that I fear will prove mortal. The beauty of that lady I see wandering in the garden there is the sole cause of my crying out and of my grief. Whether she is a goddess or a woman I cannot tell, but by my guess it is Venus herself.' And with that he fell down on his knees and said, 'Venus, if it be your will to manifest yourself in this garden to so sorrowful and wretched a creature as I, help us to escape from this prison; yet if my destiny is irrevocably fixed by an eternal fiat to die in captivity, have some pity upon our noble blood brought low by tyranny.'<br><br>But while he was speaking Arcite caught glimpse of the lady as she walked to and fro. At the sight of her beauty he was so shaken that if Palamon was sorely wounded, Arcite was as badly hit or more. Sadly he said, "The fresh beauty of that girl wandering there has dealt me a blow as sudden as it is mortal; unless I obtain her pity and favour so that I can at least see her, I am no better than a dead man&#x2014;that's all I can say.'<br><br>When he heard these words Palamon replied sharply, 'Do you say that in game or in earnest?' <br><br>'In earnest and good faith,' returned Arcite, 'So help me God, I am in no mood to joke.'<br><br>Palamon knitted his brows and answered, 'It would do you no great honour were you to prove faithless or a traitor to me, seeing that I am not only your cousin but your sworn brother. We are each bound to the other by the most solemn oaths: that never till death do us part&#x2014;not even death by torture&#x2014;shall either stand in the other's way in matters of love or of anything else. On the contrary you, dear brother, must always come faithfully to my aid just as I must come to yours. That was your sworn oath, and mine also, and I know perfectly well that you dare not gainsay it. For this reason I trustfully confided in you; but now you are treacherously seeking to love the lady whom I must always love and serve till my heart stops beating. No, you won't, false Arcite, that's certain! I was first to love her; I told you about it only because, as I said before, you are the confidant of my secrets, my sworn brother pledged to come to my help, and therefore bound as a knight to give me what aid you can&#x2014;otherwise I dare call you forsworn.'<br><br>Arcite disdainfully retorted: 'You are more likely to prove forsworn than I&#x2014;and you are utterly forsworn, I tell you plainly! For I loved her passionately before you did. What can you say? Just now you did not know whether she is a woman or a goddess. Yours is a spiritual affection, while mine is love of a human being&#x2014;that's why I told you what had happened to me, as to my cousin and sworn brother.<br><br>'Suppose for the sake of argument that you loved her first. Have you never heard the old philosopher's adage: 'Who can lay down the law to a lover?'' Upon my soul, love is a greater law than any decreed by mortal men; and therefore all man-made laws and like injunctions are broken every day for love by all kinds of people. A man must love, against all reason. Even if it should cost him his life there's no escaping it, whether she be maid, widow or wife. And anyway it is hardly likely you will ever win her favour any more than I shall, for as you well know we are both condemned to a perpetual imprisonment from which no ransom will buy us out. We are quarrelling like the two dogs who fought all day over a bone but got no share of it: while they bickered a kite came along and carried off the bone from between them both. And so, brother, as in high politics, it's ever man for himself&#x2014;that's all there is to it. Love her if you wish, for I love her and always will. Dear brother, each of us must endure this prison and take his chance, that's all.'</p><h2>Beardsley&#39;s Illustrations for Le Morte D&#39;Arthur</h2><p>All of Aubrey Beardsley&#39;s illustrations for Malory&#39;s Le Morte Darthur are reproduced together with selected pages from the text</p><p></p><h2>Workbook for Beck&#39;s Theory and Practice of Therapeutic Massage, 5th</h2><p>This workbook correlates to Theory and Practice of Therapeutic Massage, 5E.

The expert author team, assembled by the National Gardening Association, provides the reader with a wealth of knowledge on gardening fundamentals, like what kinds of plants grow in certain climates and how to maintain them, what types of tools to buy and where to get them, how to prune, weed and water plants, and much more.</p><p>Starting off with ultrabasics, like "how do I get my plants to live rather than die?" <i>Gardening for Dummies</i> is a terrific textbook for the novice gardener. Explanations are laid out simply, and all terms are defined as soon as they are first used--if you've never grown so much as a houseplant, this is the book to get you started. Emphasis is on choosing proper plants for your zone (it's OK--the color map will show you which zone you're in) that are fairly low-maintenance and high-success. Large sections on both seeds and bedding plants will give you lots of options and specific instructions for getting good results--seeds, especially, are treated as persnickety little critters that require some extra effort in exchange for low cost and large variety. The big downside to this book is its lack of pictures. There are lots of line drawings, but they tend to show particular stages of a process, rather than each step. Color photos are limited to two sections, and most of them are close-ups of various plants. While it's nice to see what the bark of a paperbark maple looks like, it doesn't particularly add to the value of the book. For folks who learn best with straightforward reading, the sections on mulching, pruning, soil preparation, and tool choices are all extremely helpful. With bullet-point lists, icons for highlighting categories like ecofriendly or time-saving, and simple tables and charts, how-to photos aren't essential, but if pictorial aids are what you need for learning, look elsewhere. <i>--Jill Lightner</i>"Packed with down-to-earth gardening advice."

Overnight, Yvonne, Annette, C�cile, �milie, and Marie Dionne mesmerized the globe, defying medical history with every breath they took. In an effort to protect them from hucksters and showmen, the Ontario government took custody of the five identical babies, sequestering them in a private, custom-built hospital across the road from their family--and then, in a stunning act of hypocrisy, proceeded to exploit them for the next nine years. The Dionne Quintuplets became a more popular attraction than Niagara Falls, ogled through one-way screens by sightseers as they splashed in their wading pool at the center of a tourist hotspot known as Quintland. Here, Sarah Miller reconstructs their unprecedented upbringing with fresh depth and subtlety, bringing to new light their resilience and the indelible bond of their unique sisterhood.</p><p><b>Sarah Miller</b> is the author of the historical fiction novels <i>Miss Spitfire: Reaching Helen Keller</i>,&nbsp;which was called &#x201c;an accomplished debut&#x201d; in a starred review from&nbsp;<i>Booklist</i>&nbsp;and was named an ALA&#x2013;ALSC Notable Children&#x2019;s Book, and&nbsp;<i>The Lost Crown</i>,&nbsp;a novel hailed as &#x201c;fascinating&#x201d; in a starred review from&nbsp;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>&nbsp;and named an ALA&#x2013;YALSA Best Book for Young Adults.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> November 1943<br> &nbsp;<br> In an empty nursery, behind two woven wire fences topped with barbed wire, five nine-year-old girls waited for their father. Five suitcases sat alongside them. Five smiling Shirley Temple dolls were clutched in their arms. Yvonne stared out the window at the yellow brick mansion up the hill. Annette quietly seethed, pretending not to be afraid. C�cile sat in a corner, rocking her doll. �milie prayed that it was all just a bad dream. Marie tried to tell a silly story, but no one laughed.<br> At the sound of their father&#x2019;s footsteps in the hall, all five sisters hugged their Shirley Temples closer to their chests. The moment they dreaded had come.<br> For the first time in their lives, the Dionne Quintuplets were going home.<br> Oliva Dionne did not speak as he and his five identical daughters walked through the hospital&#x2019;s guarded gate, down the road, and through another gate that led to the colossal Georgian house that was to be their new home. He did not lead them up the steps to the grand front door. Instead, he entered through a service door into the kitchen. Yvonne followed first, trying to be brave for her sisters&#x2019; sake. Though Yvonne was no more than a few minutes older than Annette, C�cile, �milie, and Marie, she had acted the part of the little mother since she was a toddler. For nine years Mr. Dionne had battled with the government to unite his family under a single roof. Now that his triumphant moment had arrived, the man who had once crawled through a drainpipe to elude hospital guards just so he could glimpse his five famous babies through a window spoke a single sentence.<br> &#x201c;The little girls are here,&#x201d; he told his wife, and continued into the house, leaving his daughters standing in the unfamiliar kitchen with their dolls and suitcases.<br> &#x201c;Bonsoir, Mom,&#x201d; Yvonne, Annette, C�cile, �milie, and Marie said, greeting their mother in a mixture of French and English.<br> &#x201c;Supper will be ready soon,&#x201d; Mrs. Dionne replied in French, then called for two of her elder daughters. &#x201c;Show the little girls around the house,&#x201d; she instructed.<br> Without a word, &#x201c;the little girls&#x201d; followed as their big sisters pointed into one doorway after another. The living room, the den, the sewing room, their father&#x2019;s office. Redolent of fresh paint and filled with pristine furniture, the house felt new and sterile, more sterile by far than the hospital that had been their home since they were four months old.<br> Then they reached the dining room.

Twenty years ago I made Book from the Sky, a book of illegible Chinese characters that no one could read. Now I have created Book from the Ground, a book that anyone can read. -Xu Bing Following his classic work Book from the Sky, the Chinese artist Xu Bing presents a new graphic novel-one composed entirely of symbols and icons that are universally understood. Xu Bing spent seven years gathering materials, experimenting, revising, and arranging thousands of pictograms to construct the narrative of Book from the Ground. The result is a readable story without words, an account of twenty-four hours in the life of &#34;Mr. Black,&#34; a typical urban white-collar worker. Our protagonist&#39;s day begins with wake-up calls from a nearby bird and his bedside alarm clock; it continues through tooth-brushing, coffee-making, TV-watching, and cat-feeding. He commutes to his job on the subway, works in his office, ponders various fast-food options for lunch, waits in line for the bathroom, daydreams, sends flowers, socializes after work, goes home, kills a mosquito, goes to bed, sleeps, and gets up the next morning to do it all over again. His day is recounted with meticulous and intimate detail, and reads like a postmodern, post-textual riff on James Joyce&#39;s account of Bloom&#39;s peregrinations in Ulysses. But Xu Bing&#39;s narrative, using an exclusively visual language, could be published anywhere, without translation or explication; anyone with experience in contemporary life-anyone who has internalized the icons and logos of modernity, from smiley faces to transit maps to menus-can understand it.</p><p><p>While this book might turn off readers looking to escape into a more conventional narrative, anyone interested in experimental fiction, modern art, or a little bit of challenge will be delighted.</p>--<i>Library Journal</i>Xu Bing is an internationally acclaimed artist whose work has been shown and collected by museums and galleries including the National Art Museum of China; the British Museum; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; the Museum of Modern Art; the Metropolitan Museum of Art; and the Arthur M.

Derrida has paid him homage as "master." An original philosopher who combines the insights of phenomenological analysis with those of Jewish spirituality, Emmanuel Levinas has proven to be of extraordinary importance in the history of modern thought. Collecting Levinas's important writings on religion, <i>Difficult Freedom</i> contributes to a growing debate about the significance of religion&#x2015;particularly Judaism and Jewish spiritualism&#x2015;in European philosophy. Topics include ethics, aesthetics, politics, messianism, Judaism and women, and Jewish-Christian relations, as well as the work of Spinoza, Hegel, Heidegger, Franz Rosenzweig, Simone Weil, and Jules Issac. </p></p><p><p>Contributes to a growing debate about the significance of religion&#x2015;particularly Judaism and Jewish spiritualism&#x2015;in European philosophy. </p><p><b>Emmanuel Levinas </b> was born in Kaunas, Lithuania, in 1906, and became a naturalized French citizen in 1930.

With boundless energy and a delicious sense of humor, Boris Vian takes readers on a star-studded romp through the underground culture of jazz clubs, Left Bank caf�s, surrealist and existentialist literature, and the various eccentrics and artists that made up this legendary scene. <br>Paris in the &#x2018;50s was an incredible place and time: With the end of the war, everything seemed possible. The list of luminaries Vian ran with, and who are captured here in previously unpublished photographs, includes Simone de Beauvoir, Albert Camus, Juliette Gr�co, Miles Davis, Duke Ellington, Jean-Paul Sartre, Jean Genet, Jacques Pr�vert, and Jean Cocteau.<br>&#x201c;Vian has been canonized by a whole generation of revolutionary young people...this fantasy of perishing purity is an affirmation of youth and innocence, laced with the biting humor of Jacques Pr�vert and Ionesco.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015; Newsweek</p><p>Boris Vian&#x2019;s (1920&#x2014;1959) work ranges from the best-selling sex-and-violence thrillers under the name of Vernon Sullivan to the beautiful, surreal novels he wrote under his own name, L'Arrache coeur (Heartsnatcher), L'Herbe rouge, and his masterpiece L'Ecume des jours (Foam of the Daze). After his death he became a hero to the '68 student revolution in France, where his literary fame grew. He is a cult hero in England and America.<br>Georges Dudognon (1922&#x2014;2001) haunted the St-Germain-des-Pr�s of postwar Paris, choosing photography as his way of recording the exuberance of the times.</p><h2>Courtyards: Aesthetic, Social, and Thermal Delight</h2><p>COURTYARDS<br> Aesthetic, Social, and Thermal Delight<br> Courtyards is an artful, informative exploration of courtyards, from their origins in early civilization to contemporary design concepts. Architects and landscape architects will repeatedly turn to the detailed guidelines for reference, gain a greater sense of balance between building and garden, and cultivate optimal green space by using the practical planting tips. Over one hundred photographs and drawings illustrate the concepts written about by an authority and passionate scholar in his field.</p><p>Courtyards are special areas that allow the inside and outside to mingle; where rain, wind, daylight, night darkness, and sound can be showcased; and, simply, they are niches of beauty and solace. Since at least 3000 b.c., courtyards have been incorporated into the architecture of the day as a significant part of the physical and cultural landscape. Today, the courtyard continues to be an evolving and popular aspect of design through which landscapers and designers can create privacy amidst increased property development.<br> <br> Courtyards presents a survey of courtyards, contemporary design guidelines, and a diverse selection of examples. Readers will acquire a basic understanding of the balance that must exist between garden and building, including practical advice for planting.<br> <br> First, a brief history of courtyards is presented, including itemized accounts of topics such as placement within a building, orientation, exposure, common activities in and around courtyards, and the promotion of temperate conditions within the courtyard. Next, an ample section of examples follows, generously supplemented with over fifty full-color photographs from Spain and Latin America. These exquisite images are accompanied by temperature charts, solar diagrams, and other key technical information about courtyards. Finally, an extensive section of planning and design guidelines highlights factors for consideration, such as daytime/ nighttime temperature ranges, zoning regulations, proportions, and innovative proposals incorporating driveways and uses of rainwater.<br> <br> Architects, landscape architects, and urban designers and planners will find this an ideal starting point for creating or renovating any courtyard. Students of all these disciplines can use Courtyards as an inclusive, easy-to-use reference.JOHN S. REYNOLDS is a professor of architecture at the University of Oregon.

The journals she kept at Alfoxden, in 1798, where her brother and Coleridge were composing the <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> and at Grasmere from 1800 to 1803, when she and Wordsworth were living at Dove Cottage are printed here for the first time as Dorothy wrote them. Two of Dorothy's poems are included in the appendix, along with thirty-three poems by Wordsworth, which are referred to in the journals.</p><p>Dorothy Mae Ann Wordsworth (1771 1855) was an English author, poet and diarist.</p><h2>Like Men of War: Black Troops in the Civil War, 1862-1865</h2><p>Drawing on diaries and letters, an award-winning Civil War historian offers the first comprehensive, copiously illustrated military history of black soldiers in the Union army, vividly recreating their courage in the face of battle.</p><p><i>Like Men of War</i> corrects a sad case of historical amnesia that began in the 1880s and continues, with only a few exceptions, into the present. Using letters, diaries, service records, and other contemporary material, Noah Andre Trudeau tells the story of the brave black men who fought and died for their freedom in the U.S. Civil War. The tale begins in 1862, when many in the Union opposed recruiting blacks as soldiers. The story ends after Reconstruction, with their hopes for equality dashed, as Federal troops ceded control of the South to Southerners. In addition to photographs, <i>Like Men of War</i> includes about 60 maps and accounts of many of the 449 engagements in which blacks fought.By National Public Radio producer Trudeau (Out of the Storm, 1994, etc.), another solid contribution to Civil War literature, this time about the experience of the so-called Colored Troops, who fought on the Union side. In recent years, films and books, particularly Joseph T. Glatthaar's Forged in Battle, have focused scholarly attention on the once-neglected exploits of the more than 175,000 black troops who fought in the Civil War. In an account more thorough and expansive than Glatthaar's, Trudeau shows little-known varieties of black military experience: Amazingly, free blacks in the South offered their military services to the Confederacy at the war's outset, before the North made abolition one of its wartime goals, and blacks in the multiracial areas of Louisiana and the Trans- Mississippi had well-developed military traditions dating back to the War of 1812. The Confederacy never made use of blacks as soldiers, however. Well before the final Emancipation Proclamation, units of back US troops were being sent into combat. Trudeau describes how, unreasonably, Northern editors and military men repeatedly asked whether the former slaves could fight as well as white men, even after units of the ``US Colored Troops'' had proved that they could. Trudeau compellingly captures many of their actions in detail, including moments of glory, like the capture of Fort Fisher by black troops on Jan. 15, 1865; moments of tragedy and bravery, like the failed July 18, 1863, assault on Fort Wagner; and moments of savagery, like the massacre of black soldiers at Fort Pillow by Confederates under Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest on April 12, 1864. Trudeau also traces the curious historical fate of the African-American soldiers after their mustering out: In the revisionist historiography and racist culture of early 20th centry America, they were forgotten, and even in African-American culture and literature, their achievements were neglected. Another fine work by Trudeau, and a good companion to Glatthaar's study. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Though best known for Brave New World, he also wrote countless works of fiction, non-fiction, poetry and essays. A humanist, pacifist and satirist, he wrote novels and other works that functioned as critiques of social norms and ideals. Aldous Huxley is often considered a leader of modern thought and one of the most important literary and philosophical voices of the 20th century.Robert Whitfield&#39;s unabridged reading of Huxley&#39;s first novel is a triumph of one man&#39;s vocal capacities. Crome Yellow introduces many ideas Huxley would explore in fuller and more exact detail later, but Whitfield&#39;s vocal acrobatics in portraying the cast of characters assembled at an English country estate for a summer vacation in the 1920&#39;s makes for dazzling aural entertainment. Otherwise fatuous goings-on become intriguing shenanigans, and the characters&#39; psychological portraits are rendered accurately through the unique voices Whitfield assigns them.

See scans and description. New York: Oxford University Press, 1990. 10th printing of this Oxford edition. 12mo, illustrated perfect-bound wraps, xxii + 478 pp. + 4 pp. ads. Very Good, with demure and unobtrusive original owner&#39;s signature at title page. No other writing, inside or out. Page edges slightly age-toned, touch-wear at corners and other peripheral places, several very small spots of cover soiling. Firmly bound, tight, bright and unmarked but for the mentioned signature. Not for collecting, perhaps, but definitely for reading - which is what one should do anyway, with this piece of extraordinary poetry, considered by many to be one of the two (along with Ginsberg&#39;s &#39;Howl&#34;) greatest American epic poems. See scans. L-11n</p><p>One of the great innovative figures in American letters, Walt Whitman created a daringly new kind of poetry that became a major force in world literature. <i>Leaves Of Grass</i> is his one book. First published in 1855 with only twelve poems, it was greeted by Ralph Waldo Emerson as "the wonderful gift . . . the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed." Over the course of Whitman's life, the book reappeared in many versions, expanded and transformed as the author's experiences and the nation's history changed and grew. Whitman's ambition was to creates something uniquely American. In that he succeeded. His poems have been woven into the very fabric of the American character. From his solemn masterpieces "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd" and "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking" to the joyous freedom of "Song of Myself," "I Sing the Body Electric," and "Song of the Open Road," Whitman's work lives on, an inspiration to the poets of later generations.The poetry of Walt Whitman is the cornerstone of modern American verse. He was America's first truly great poet and his influence is still evident today. The first edition of Whitman's "Leaves of Grass, published in 1855, was a revolutionary manifesto declaring America's independence from European cultural domination. His rhapsodic free verse broke radically with poetic, tradition: it was poetry about America, its democracy, its people, and its hopes. It was uniquely American without apology--brash, proud, optimistic, and filled with the bustling energy of the new and growing nation.<br>This collection brings together Whitman's greatest and most famous poems spanning the whole of his career. From the groundbreaking first edition of "Leaves of Grass are seven poems, including "Song of Myself" and "I Sing the Body Electric."<br>From later editions there are such masterpieces as "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry," "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking," and "I Hear America Singing." Also included is Whitman's great cycle of Civil War Poems, "Drum-Taps, which he wrote in the months when he was ministering to the wounded in battlefield hospitals. Concluding this collection is one of his last poems, "Good-bye My Fancy!"--his touching farewell to his muse, his life, and his readers.<br>More than one hundred years after his death, Walt Whitman's poetry has become part of the American heritage. It is a visionary which speaks as aptly to readers today as it will to future generations. As he says in "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry," "others...look back on me because I look'd forward to them." Whitman's poetry is a link that connects all Americans--past, present, and future.<br>This book features a deluxe cover, ribbon marker, top stain, and decorative endpaper with a nameplate.</p><h2>The Complete Book of Fingermath: Simple, Accurate,Scientific</h2><p>Describes techniques for using one&#39;s fingers as a calculator to perform a variety of complex as well as simple arithmetic operations including multiplication, division, and algebra</p><p></p><h2>Vulnerable Populations in the United States</h2><p>Based on the authors' teaching and research at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California, the second edition of this landmark text offers a general framework for students, researchers, practitioners, and policymakers for learning about vulnerable populations.

Their father has recently died, and their mother supports the family by baking bread and renting a corner of the small house to Zimmel, the cobbler. Little Esther is always getting into scrapes, much to the annoyance--and amusement--of big sister Leah. Letters to and from relatives in faraway Minnesota are a highlight of life, as is a chance to run an errand that takes one past the shop windows in the village. Small details of Jewish life and customs are woven into the simple story. Herman tells her tale with obvious affection for the characters, and, while the ending is a bit abrupt, the overall effect is warmly nostalgic.

Our options are being placed before us by the tide of events -- and by those who are creating them. We can either move forward, building together at last a new world of peace and harmony based on new beliefs about God and Life, or move backward, separately and continuously reconstructing the old world of conflict and discord. The New Revelations provides us with the tools to move forward, to pull ourselves out of despair, lifting the whole human race to a new expression of its grandest vision. In this book, which offers possible and powerful answers to the questions facing the world, bestselling author Neale Donald Walsch urges us to open our hearts and minds to what may be one of the most important spiritual statements of our time. A conversation with God that began as a simple plea from one human being to the God of his understanding, The New Revelations is a life-altering book, given to us when we need it most.</p><p><b>Neale Donald Walsch</b> devotes his<p>time to sharing the messages of his books through writing, lecturing, and facilitating spiritual renewal retreats.

We need help. </p><p> I am here. </p><p> We need help. </p><p> I know. </p><p> Right now. </p><p> I understand. </p><p> The world is on the brink of disaster. And I'm not talking about natural disaster; I'm talking about man-made calamity. </p><p> I know. And you're right. </p><p> I mean, humans have had disagreements before, and serious ones, but now our divisions and disagreements can lead not simply to wars -- which are bad enough -- but to the end of civilization as we know it. </p><p> That is correct. You have assessed the situation correctly. </p><p> You understand the severity of the problem; you simply do not understand the nature of the problem. You do not know what is causing it. So you keep trying to solve it at every level except the level at which it exists. </p><p> Which is? </p><p> The level of belief. </p><p> <i>The problem facing the world today is a spiritual problem. </i></p><p><i> Your ideas about spirituality are killing you.</i> </p><p> You keep trying to solve the world's problem as if it were a political problem, or an economic problem, or even a military problem, <i>and it is none of these.</i> It is a spiritual problem. And that is the one problem human beings don't seem to know how to solve. </p><p> Then help us. </p><p> I am. </p><p> How? </p><p> In many ways. </p><p> Name one. </p><p> This book. </p><p> This book will help us? </p><p> It can. </p><p> What do we have to do? </p><p> Read it. </p><p> And then what? </p><p> Heed it. </p><p> That's what they all say. "It's all in The Book," they say. "Read it and heed it. That's all you have to do." The problem is, <i>they all hold up a different book.</i> </p><p> I know. </p><p> And every book says something else. </p><p> I know. </p><p> So now we should "read and heed" <i>this book?</i> </p><p> It's not a question of what you should do. It's a question of what you may do if you choose to. It is an invitation, not a requirement. </p><p> Why would I want to read this book when I've already been told by True Believers that all the answers are in the <i>other</i> books -- the books that <i>they</i> are telling me to heed? </p><p> Because you have not heeded them. </p><p> Yes, we have. We believe that we have. </p><p> That's why you now need help. You believe that you have, but you have not. </p><p> You keep saying that your Holy Book (your cultures have many different ones) is what has given you the authority to treat each other the way you are treating each other, to do what you are doing. </p><p> You are able to say that only because you have not really listened to the deeper message of these books. You have read them, but you have not really <i>listened</i> to them. </p><p> But we <i>have.</i> We are doing what they <i>say</i> we should be doing! </p><p> No. You are doing what YOU say that they say you should be doing. </p><p> What does that mean? </p><p> It means that the basic message of all the sacred scriptures is the same. What is different is how human beings have been interpreting them. </p><p> There is nothing "wrong" with having different interpretations. What may not benefit you, however, is separating yourself over these differences, making each other wrong because of these differences, and killing each other as a result of these differences. </p><p> This is what you are now doing. </p><p> It is what you have been doing for quite some time. </p><p> You cannot agree even within a particular group of you, much less between groups, about what a particular book says and what it means, and you use these disagreements as justifications for slaughter. </p><p> You argue among yourselves about what the Qur'an says, and about what its words mean. You argue among yourselves about what the Bible says, and about what its words mean. You argue among yourselves about what the Veda says, what the Bhagavad-Gita says, what the Lun-yu says, what the Pali Canon says, what the Tao-te Ching says, what the Talmud says, what the Hadith says, what the Book of Mormon says... </p><p> And what of the Upanishad, the I Ching, the Adi Granth, the Mahabharata, the Yoga-sutras, the Mathnawi, the Kojiki? </p><p> Okay, we get the point. </p><p> No, actually, you don't. And <i>that's</i> the point. The point is, there are <i>many</i> holy writings and sacred scriptures, and you act as if there is only one. </p><p> It is <i>your</i> sacred scripture that is <i>really</i> sacred. All the rest are poor substitutes at best, and blasphemies at worst. </p><p> Not only is there only one Sacred Scripture, there is also only one way to <i>interpret</i> that Scripture: your way. </p><p> This spiritual arrogance is what has caused you your greatest sorrow as a species. You have suffered more -- and caused <i>other</i> people to suffer more -- over your ideas about God than over your ideas about anything else in the human experience. </p><p> You have turned the source of the greatest joy into the source of your greatest pain. </p><p> That's <i>crazy.</i> Why is that? <i>Why have we done that?</i> </p><p> Because there is one thing for which human beings seem willing to give up everything. </p><p> They will give up love, they will give up peace, they will give up health, harmony, and happiness, they will give up safety, security, and even their sanity, for this one thing. </p><p> What? </p><p> Being right. </p><p> You are willing to give up everything you've ever worked for, everything you've ever wanted, everything you've ever created, in order to be "right." </p><p> Indeed, for this you are willing to give up Life itself. </p><p> But isn't that how it should be? I mean, you have to stand up for <i>something</i> in life. And the Word of God IS what's right! </p><p> Which God? </p><p> Which God? </p><p> Yes, which God? </p><p> Adonai? Allah? Elohim? God? Hari? Jehovah? Krishna? Lord? Rama? Vishnu? Yahwey? </p><p> The God whose words were brought to us clearly by the Master and the Prophets. </p><p> Which Master and which Prophets? </p><p> Which Master? Which Prophets? </p><p> Yes. </p><p> Adam? Noah? Abraham? Moses? Confucius? Siddhartha Gautama? Jesus? Patanjali? Muhammad? Baha'u'llah? Jalal al-Din Rumi? Martin Luther? Joseph Smith? Paramahansa Yogananda? </p><p> You're not equating all of those with each other, are you? </p><p> Why not? Is one greater than the other? </p><p> Certainly! </p><p> Which one? </p><p> The one in whom I believe! </p><p> Exactly. <i>Now</i> you get the point. </p><p> So what do you want me to do, give up my beliefs? </p><p> I don't "want" you to do anything. The question is, what do you want to do? </p><p> I want to find a way to get past all of these mixed-up beliefs that humans have. </p><p> There is a way. </p><p> Which is? </p><p> Transcend them. </p><p> What does that mean? </p><p> Transcending means to go beyond, to move past. It does not mean to completely reject or totally destroy. You do not have to destroy a thing in order to move past it. </p><p> You would not want to destroy your old belief system in any event, because there is too much of it that you will wish to retain. </p><p> "Transcending" does not mean always being "other than," it means always being "larger than." Your new, larger belief system will no doubt retain some of the old -- that part of the old belief system that you experience as still serving you -- and so it will be a combination of the new and the old, not a rejection of the old from top to bottom. </p><p> Can you see the difference? </p><p> I think so. </p><p> Good. Then you can stop your resistance. </p><p> The reason humans have hung so tenaciously to their old beliefs is that they do not want to dishonor those beliefs by rejecting them completely, out of hand. They think that this is the choice they have: Reject the old or accept the old, totally. Yet that is not the only choice you have. You can review the old and see what parts of the old no longer work. You can expand the old to make some parts of the old work better. You can add to the old to make some parts of your belief system new. </p><p> Rejecting completely your present beliefs would be to discredit so much of what has been taught, so much of what has been understood, so much of what has been done -- and so much of what has been <i>good.</i> </p><p> It would make too much of the world feel "wrong." It would make ancestors "wrong," it would make entire scriptures "wrong," it would make present-day <i>lives</i> "wrong."

His first&nbsp;career, beginning as an army intelligence officer&nbsp;and including a distinguished run as one of&nbsp;Congress&#x2019;s most powerful and respected members,&nbsp;lasted thirty-five years and culminated in his&nbsp;transformational role as Clinton&#x2019;s budget czar&nbsp;and White House chief of staff. He then &#x201c;retired&#x201d;&nbsp;to establish the Panetta Institute with his wife of&nbsp;fifty years, Sylvia; to serve on the Iraq Study Group;&nbsp;and to protect his beloved California coastline. But&nbsp;in 2009, he accepted what many said was a thankless&nbsp;task: returning to public office as the director of&nbsp;the CIA, taking it from a state of turmoil after the&nbsp;Bush-era torture debates and moving it back to&nbsp;the vital center of America&#x2019;s war against Al Qaeda,&nbsp;including the campaign that led to the killing of&nbsp;Osama bin Laden. And then, in the wake of bin&nbsp;Laden&#x2019;s death, Panetta became the U.S. secretary&nbsp;of defense, inheriting two troubled wars in a time&nbsp;of austerity and painful choices.<br><br>Like his career, <i>Worthy Fights</i> is a reflection&nbsp;of Panetta&#x2019;s values. It is imbued with the frank,&nbsp;grounded, and often quite funny spirit of a man&nbsp;who never lost touch with where he came from:&nbsp;his family&#x2019;s walnut farm in beautiful Carmel Valley,&nbsp;California. It is also a testament to a lost kind of&nbsp;political leadership, which favors progress and duty&nbsp;to country over partisanship. Panetta is a Democrat&nbsp;who pushed for balanced budgets while also&nbsp;expanding care for the elderly and sick; a devout&nbsp;Catholic who opposes the death penalty but had&nbsp;to weigh every drone strike from 2009 through&nbsp;2011. Throughout his career, Panetta&#x2019;s polestar has&nbsp;been his belief that a public servant&#x2019;s real choice is&nbsp;between leadership or crisis. Troubles always come&nbsp;about through no fault of one&#x2019;s own, but most can&nbsp;be prevented with courage and foresight.<br><br>As always, Panetta calls them as he sees them&nbsp;in <i>Worthy Fights</i>. Suffused with its author&#x2019;s decency&nbsp;and stubborn common sense, the book is an epic&nbsp;American success story, a great political memoir,&nbsp;and a revelatory view onto many of the great&nbsp;figures and events of our time.</p><p><b>Leon Panetta</b> served as the director of the&nbsp;Central Intelligence Agency from 2009&#x2013;2011, and as&nbsp;secretary of defense from 2011&#x2013;2013.

She was laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery, in the shade of a stately line of willow oaks, amid thousands of American heroes and in the company of hundreds of friends, family, and coworkers from the Central Intelligence Agency. I was at the time the director of the CIA. Elizabeth Hanson had worked for me.</p><p>It was a graveside service, modest and brief; she was buried in Area 60, beside many veterans of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, just over a small rise from the Pentagon. Hanson and six other members of our agency were killed on December 30, 2009, at a remote CIA base in the Khost province of eastern Afghanistan. Liz Hanson and her colleagues were there that day to meet a potential agent, a jihadist who said he wanted to work for the CIA and steer us to the leadership of Al Qaeda. Instead, when he arrived at the meeting he detonated a diabolically powerful suicide vest, killing seven of our best and injuring a dozen more. That explosion was a signal tragedy for the CIA&#x2014;one of the largest losses of life in the agency&#x2019;s history.</p><p>The attack shook the CIA, and I had spent much of that winter and spring consoling our employees and traveling around America to share the grief of the families of those men and women. Hanson&#x2019;s funeral was the last of seven such services I had attended. They included small private services and a large Catholic mass. Some were packed with dignitaries, others limited to friends and family. I met with mourners in Fredericksburg, Maryland; Virginia Beach; Clinton, Massachusetts; Akron, Ohio; and central Illinois. And this was my third trip to Arlington. After the funeral mass in Clinton, boys and girls stood in the snow outside the church, some quietly waving flags or signs that read, THANKS FOR KEEPING US SAFE. In Akron, the widow of one of our fallen, Scott Roberson, was carrying his child, a girl. One eulogist imagined the day when their daughter would come to visit the CIA and touch the star etched into the marble of our Memorial Wall, marking her father&#x2019;s sacrifice, her heart full of pride for a man she never had the luck to know.</p><p>Two realizations connected all of those ceremonies: Nothing could return those young men and women to their families, and I could only offer them a promise. America would do everything in its power to bring those behind the murders to justice. They hit us; America would hit back.</p><p>By 2010, nearly a decade after the events of September 11, 2001, the sustained response by America and its allies had significantly degraded Al Qaeda, but it remained a fighting force, still under the spell of Osama bin Laden and directed by him and his close lieutenants. Now, with the burial of Elizabeth Hanson still fresh in my mind, American analysts reported that they had found one of those deputies&#x2014;in fact, one of those directly responsible for the attack at Khost. He was down for the night, deep in a terrorist compound.</p><p>That was a significant piece of news. This terrorist was a shrewd and methodical operative who had risen within Al Qaeda in recent years while repeatedly eluding our attempts to take him off the battlefield. Khost was only the latest of his crimes. So finding him represented a victory in and of itself.</p><p>There was, however, a catch: He was not alone. Al Qaeda leaders knew that American policy was to avoid civilian casualties wherever possible, and they had adapted their habits to that realization. By 2010, the organization&#x2019;s top terrorists would often stay close to family members or other noncombatants, theorizing that those shields would dissuade the United States from conducting operations against them. Some leaders who had long traveled by themselves now brought along children, exploiting our humanity while debasing their own. Now with our target in the house half a world away were a wife and at least two children. The reports suggested that others might be in the house as well. Any operation against him might kill others too.</p><p>That was not a prospect I took lightly. I was raised Catholic. I was an altar boy. Since my earliest years, I&#x2019;ve attended mass on Sundays and holy days. I carry a rosary and believe that life is sacred. Moreover, I&#x2019;m a husband and the father of three sons. But I also deeply believe in duty to country. I have spent the majority of my life in the service of the United States&#x2014;I was in the army, I was a Senate aide and later director of the Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, aide to the mayor of New York City, congressman for the Central Coast of California, Office of Management and Budget director, and chief of staff to President Bill Clinton. I&#x2019;ve had the honor of being elected by the people of my hometown and endured the stress of being fired by President Nixon. In 2010, at the helm of the CIA, this time placed in a position of responsibility by President Obama, I was once again mindful of my duty. In each of those jobs, I&#x2019;ve tried to focus on the obligations that they entail. I&#x2019;ve fought to desegregate schools, to protect the California coastline, to balance the federal budget. I&#x2019;ve done so out of a sense of duty, and also of obligation, of repaying a debt that my family owes this nation.</p><p>That&#x2019;s because this nation made my family&#x2019;s dreams possible. I&#x2019;m the son of Italian immigrants who came to this country to give their children a better life. That was their dream of country and family, and I am acutely conscious of fulfilling that dream, of recognizing the opportunities that the United States offered. This country has given me much, and I take seriously my obligations to serve and protect it.</p><p>So in this situation the moral dilemma was this: If one of those responsible for Elizabeth Hanson&#x2019;s murder was allowed to escape, he might kill others, including more Americans. But to eliminate the threat on that night might require taking the lives of innocents. In such a situation, how does one balance duty to country and respect for life?</p><p>From a small room at the National Security Agency, which I happened to be visiting, I spoke to White House officials to review the matter. They sounded a note of caution. Avoiding collateral damage had been a hallmark of President Obama&#x2019;s approach to these operations. All of us knew that any operation that killed civilians was to be authorized only under extraordinary circumstances. Did these qualify? We all understood that if our target was spared in order to protect his family, he would strike at us again, and without the compunctions that we had regarding the deaths of civilians.</p><p>After a few searching moments, I made up my own mind. The professionals working on this mission needed to keep looking for a way to isolate him, to minimize any risk to anyone else. But all of us working on national security matters for the United States had an overriding obligation: He could not be allowed to get away.</p><p>Hours later, he was dead. A grave threat to America had been eliminated. His wife, with whom this country had no quarrel, died in the same operation.</p><p>The challenges of protecting this nation, safeguarding its economy, providing opportunity to its citizens, and preserving its treasures have been mainstays of my life. Those challenges are rarely easy, and they sometimes demand deep searching of one&#x2019;s soul, the fingering of a rosary, the whispered Hail Mary. In considering those questions, I have been blessed with gifted mentors and, especially, loving parents whose devotion to the United States was forged in their appreciation for the opportunities it offered. It is with my parents that my story begins.</p><p></p><p></p><p>PART I</p><p>POLITICS AND PROGRESS</p><p></p><p></p><p>ONE</p><p>&#x201c;A Better Life&#x201d;</p><p>My father arrived in the United States in the fashion of so many who came before and so many who would follow: He came in search of opportunity, and found it after passing through the sober and hopeful halls of Ellis Island. He was one of eighteen hundred third-class passengers aboard the <i>Providence,</i> which landed on October 25, 1921. He declared his profession as &#x201c;peasant&#x201d; and his total assets as twenty-five dollars. He was en route to join his older brother Bruno, then in Sheridan, Wyoming. My father was the youngest of thirteen siblings. His name was Carmelo Panetta, and he was twenty-three years old.</p><p>He first left home during World War I, when he was drafted into the Italian army. He was wounded in 1918 during the Battle of the Piave River, an important Italian victory. He rarely talked about that experience, for my father was a quiet man, resolute and hardworking, devoted to values that some might find quaint: family, duty, faith. He did not lecture on those ideas, but he lived them. He also was a very good cook.</p><p>After working briefly in New York and Wyoming, he joined the sibling to whom he was closest, his rambunctious brother Tony, in California, and found a job as a cook. Like so many immigrants before and since, he took jobs wherever he could. He worked in Huntington Beach, south of Los Angeles, and Marin County, north of San Francisco, making a decent living but finding himself lonely in his adopted country. He was past his thirtieth birthday, and his vision of himself as a husband and father was missing a few pieces. Though my father had been in the United States for nearly a decade by then, his search for a bride turned him toward home. He knew where to look for a nice Italian girl. In 1932, he sailed for Italy.</p><p>He found my mother in church. Family lore is a little murky on the details but clear on the basics: Having returned to Calabria, at the toe of the boot of Italy, my father ventured down the mountains from his native Gerace to the slightly more prosperous coastal village of Siderno. There, he stood at the back of a church one Sunday and spotted a tall, dark-haired, attractive young woman. He made inquiries and discovered that the lovely eighteen-year-old Carmelina who had caught his eye was the daughter of Giuseppe Prochilo, a local member of the merchant marine. Inquiries were made and at least one obstacle was overcome: My Nona initially objected to the union, preferring instead that my father be betrothed to Carmelina&#x2019;s older sister, who wasn&#x2019;t getting any younger. Nona also objected to my father&#x2019;s plans to bring his new bride to America and thus away from her family. But my father persisted. He wanted the girl he had seen in church. Eventually, and with the help of my Nono, he prevailed. Perseverance was one of his strongest traits.</p><p>Now wed, Carmelo returned to the United States with his young bride and retraced his steps. They arrived in New York, where Carmelo had bought a small piece of property, but elected to move on, heading again for Wyoming and his brother Bruno. Bruno was a hard worker and had a big family; his three sons proudly served in World War II and later ran a successful food wholesale business. It was there, in Sheridan in 1933, that my mother gave birth to my brother, Joe. But both the harsh winters and the tough economic times were hard on my parents. They did not stay long. Seeking better weather and opportunity, they pushed forward to California, where they rejoined Tony. This time the young couple with their infant son eventually landed in Monterey.</p><p>It&#x2019;s easy to see what appealed to them. Monterey in those days&#x2014;and even today&#x2014;has an Italian feel. It&#x2019;s nestled in a beautiful bay, and the deep water of the Pacific Coast offered a bountiful fishing ground. Much of the city was devoted to fishing&#x2014;many men fished and many women worked in the processing factories made famous by John Steinbeck&#x2019;s <i>Cannery Row,</i> which was published just a few years after the Panetta family made Monterey our home. Steinbeck&#x2019;s great novel captured the spirit of Monterey&#x2014;raucous, tender, a little threadbare, but very tightly knit. In Steinbeck&#x2019;s words, Monterey was &#x201c;a poem, a stink, a grating noise, a quality of light, a tone, a habit, a nostalgia, a dream. Cannery Row is the gathered and scattered, tin and iron and rust and splintered wood, chipped pavement and weedy lots and junk heaps, sardine canneries of corrugated iron, honky tonks, restaurants and whore houses, and little crowded groceries, and laboratories and flophouses.&#x201d;</p><p>It was there that I was born in 1938. We lived in an apartment building on Van Buren Street, in a largely Italian-American community, naturally known as &#x201c;Spaghetti Hill.&#x201d; Many of our neighbors were fishermen, and nets were hung through the alleys and backyards in the afternoons to dry. I can remember playing among them and once getting so trapped in the webbing that my brother had to come and untangle me.</p><p>My father had been working at a restaurant called Biff&#x2019;s up until about the time I was born. It was then that he and a fellow Calabrese, Dominic Luscri, decided to go into business together, with Dominic opening a bar and my father launching a restaurant of his own. The two establishments abutted each other, and a swinging door between them allowed patrons to take their drinks from Dominic&#x2019;s place to my father&#x2019;s. The new restaurant was located at the intersection of Alvarado and Del Monte in the heart of old downtown Monterey. It was called Carmelo&#x2019;s Caf�, and it became the center of our lives.</p><p>Modeled on a restaurant called New Joe&#x2019;s in San Francisco, the caf� served casual Italian fare, along with steaks and chops, hamburgers and salads. Some guests sat at the counter, others in booths. The tabletops were plain wood, no tablecloths. Carmelo&#x2019;s Caf� was open six days a week, closed on Tuesdays. Both my parents worked there, my dad as the chef, my mother anchoring the cash register. Joe and I also helped out sometimes, washing dishes, peeling potatoes, or doing other chores. The caf� was part of a lively downtown, surrounded by bars and pool halls. Customers included the colorful mix of men and women who made up Monterey in those days: fishermen, shop owners, businesspeople, and servicemen from nearby Fort Ord, which was a huge training post at the time. Thousands of young men from across the nation came to the post to train for the battlefields of World War II, so Monterey was their last stop before war, a last chance for a drink or a plate of spaghetti.</p><p>There was a button beneath the cash register that my mother used to summon the military police from the base when soldiers got too frisky with her, which was fairly often. One particularly moony soldier begged her to &#x201c;leave that Greek,&#x201d; a mistaken reference to my father, &#x201c;and run away with me.&#x201d; My mother hit the button.</p><p>Not long after I was born, my mother&#x2019;s father, my Nono, Giuseppe, came to pay us a visit. He was used to traveling&#x2014;his time in the merchant marine had taken him around the world several times in the old sailing and steam ships&#x2014;but he never could persuade my grandmother to travel far from home. As a result, he arrived by himself, thinking it would be for a brief visit, a chance to meet his youngest grandson, me.</p><p>Instead, war broke out in Europe. Nono, as I always called him, was an alien and could not return. He was stuck with us. It was my good fortune.</p><p>Through my early childhood, Nono and I were...</p></p><h2>A Woman After God&#39;s Own Heart--A Daily Devotional</h2><p><p>Elizabeth draws on wisdom from her bestselling books (more than 4 million sold) and popular "Woman After God's Own Heart" radio spots and podcasts to provide 365 dynamic devotions in a beautiful, pocket&#x2013;size, padded cover format.
